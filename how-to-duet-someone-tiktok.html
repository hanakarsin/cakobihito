Even if you're not a fan of many of the app's dances, there are numerous ways to use the tools, filters, and trends on the app to make your profile stand out.</p><p>Dueting TikToks is one way to get your content out there, increasing the likeliness the video will show up on someone's For You page. Here's how to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">duet someone</a> on TikTok.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to duet a video on TikTok.</h2><p>Dueting a video is actually really simple — if you know how to do it. First, you'll want to see if the video you want to use allows duets; this is an option some users can adjust in their privacy settings, so you'll only be able to duet a video if the original poster allows it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>To know if someone has authorized duets on their content, you'll want to click the "share" in the bottom-right corner of the screen. In the bottom row of share options, you'll want to look for an icon with two circles overlapping, with "Duet" underneath it.</p><p>If this is visible, it means that the user is allowing duets on their video, and you can create your own alongside it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@siryeehaw href=#>@siryeehaw</a><p><a title=duet href=#>##duet</a> with @aaacacia_ <a title=theoldguard href=#>##TheOldGuard</a> I KEPT SINGING ANGELICAS PART WTF</p><a title="♬ original sound - aaacacia_" href=#>♬ original sound - aaacacia_</a></figure><p>To do a duet, just click that icon and record your video as normal. What you do is completely up to you, but it's best to have an idea before you begin filming.</p><p>Once you've done that, you can now post the video, and it will show both videos side-by-side on the screen. These videos appear in your feeds as normal videos.</p><p>Just remember, it's courtesy to tag the original creator in the description of your video, so make sure you include their username before posting so they'll be able to see it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@lykab0ss href=#>@lykab0ss</a><p><a title=duet href=#>##duet</a> with @alexachalnick Can’t beat Dr. Doof but this was still fun <a title=karen href=#>##karen</a> <a title=covid href=#>##covid</a> <a title=coronavirius href=#>##coronavirius</a> <a title=theatrekid href=#>##theatrekid</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - alexachalnick" href=#>♬ original sound - alexachalnick</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why would you duet a TikTok?</h2><p>Dueting a TikTok offers even more engagement opportunities for users, giving them the option to play the video they're referring to alongside them.</p><p>Many users will duet videos to participate in a trend or a challenge. Some creators make videos with the intention of their followers making a duet with it so they can see some of the fun takes on their content.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@brianaskins href=#>@brianaskins</a><p><a title=duet href=#>##duet</a> with @slashells you definitely didn’t see a cut in the middle <a title=chain href=#>##chain</a> <a title=tiktokdance href=#>##tiktokdance</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##fyp</a> <a title=unitedwedance href=#>##UnitedWeDance</a></p><a title="♬ Smile - Lily Allen" href=#>♬ Smile - Lily Allen</a></figure><p>This is a huge trend among those who sing on the app. Some will write open-ended duets, encouraging others to make a duet video with the original and their take on the song. Others will use the duet function to harmonize, and this is especially prevalent in the acapella fans on the app.</p><p>Other times, users will duet a video to offer some commentary, especially on some of the harmful trends on the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Reactions are also a popular form of duet videos, where some will send their friends a video to react to in a duet. These are especially popular on the app.</p><p>Overall, dueting a video offers countless ways to enhance and interact with other videos on the platform — and the especially creative or funny ones usually perform well. The #duet hashtag has over 1.3 trillion views, so there are countless examples to view on TikTok.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZJ2tlal6tLvMnqannV2ptqzAzqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./queen-elizabeth-charles-iii-takes-oaths-to-succeed-mother.html><span>←</span><span>Charles III Takes Oaths To Succeed Mother</span></a>
