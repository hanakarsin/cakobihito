To us at CAN, 43 was not only frightening but inexcusable by those who should have prevented it. The massacre was wicked and completely satanic.”</p><p>“A situation where farmers are being taxed by the terrorists and bandits before they are allowed to work on their farms is unprecedented and it must be stopped by the government before it is too late. We are in a recession in the country, yet, criminals are still preventing farmers from going to farm to harvest. We are not aware of any country where similar lawlessness is taking place without being adequately checked.”</p><p>“CAN calls on the security agencies to wake up from their prolonged slumber and save their image. The government is urged to think out of the box and take adequate steps to bring the terrorists to their knees rather than finding excuses to justify failure of governance.”</p><p>“Mass burials without a full scale war is unprecedented and unacceptable. We are pained to observe that killings and kidnapping of people are no longer news in the country and no one is immune from it. Why should we be watching for a nation well situated by God to become a land that is swallowing its inhabitants?”</p><p>CAN also reassured that it will continue to pray for the nation amid rising waves of insecurity but challenged the government to be more decisive in taking far-reaching security steps to rise up and do it.</p><p>It added that “continuous sympathy through press statements or condolence visit after many souls have been wasted is not acceptable anymore. What we need is adequate protection of lives and property by those we have put in charge to do so.”</p><p>“May the Lord comfort the relatives of those who were killed and save our nation from total collapse in Jesus’ name.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze49tZqysn6V6qLXVoqWgZZWtsLa%2FxKxkraddn8K0wMifsGaekZ65tr7EZqafZZekw6a%2BzZqlnJ1dmK6vedKlmKarXZfCqa3RomSsnZOqv6rA2GaYoJ2eqcBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephen-f-austin-html.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen F.
