We were far more than partners at the United Center. We were very close. He was a dear friend, and our trust, our bond, was unbreakable.”</p><p>The Blackhawks and Bulls share the United Center, which was built in the mid-1990s, as their home stadium.</p><p>Rocky's tenure as the owner of the Blackhawks was marred by scandal, though, when in 2021 it was reported that an accusation of sexual assault by a minor league player had been covered up by several Blackhawks executives. The team was ultimately ordered to pay $2 million in fines in relation to the incident, and both fans and some in the media have been vocal in feeling that the team should have received an even harsher punishment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7ykt9hmrqKqpK96pK3UrJxmp5Zisaat06E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reactions-as-osinbajo-joins-2023-presidential-race.html><span>←</span><span>Reactions As Osinbajo Joins 2023 Presidential Race</span></a>
