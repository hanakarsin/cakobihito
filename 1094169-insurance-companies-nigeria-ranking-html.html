The reasons for this should be sought not so much in the sector of insurance services, but in the peculiarities of economic development of the African continent; it is known that economic basis of insurance is primarily the real sector of the economy. Meanwhile, industry, agricultural production, and infrastructure are the most backward areas in most African countries.</p><p class=align-left>The insurance markets of African countries due to various social, economic and political reasons are at different stages of development. Most highly developed insurance market is in South Africa - in 2011 it accounted 82% of all insurance premium collected on the continent. Moreover, the share of insurance deposits in GDP in South Africa is 18,78% - the highest in the world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/610d8690fa832599.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lai Mohammed: Increase in electricity, fuel prices will benefit ordinary Nigerians later</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/610d8690fa832599.jpeg><p class=align-left>Relatively developed insurance companies, comparing with other African countries, are considered to be in:</p><ul><li>Morocco - 4%;</li><li>Egypt - 1.8%;</li><li>Zimbabwe - 1.5%;</li><li>Nigeria - 1.3%.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Now, you will see insurance companies in Nigeria ranking – a list of top insurance companies in Nigeria:</p><p class=h3>Aiico Insurance PLC</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4eqn5khk63a.jpeg><p class=align-left>This company deals with comprehensive insurance service.
