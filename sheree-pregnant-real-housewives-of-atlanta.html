Recently, Shereé stunned <a href=#>reality TV</a> watchers by dating someone with his own successful program — <a href=#>Love & Marriage: Huntsville</a> star <a href=#>Martell Holt</a>.</p><p>In Season 15 of RHOA, Shereé introduced fans to Martell and how they’ve endured some not-so-warm welcomes from her friends and castmates. Shereé has also shared her new role as a “glamma” since <a href=#>her son, Kairo</a>, had a daughter named Mecca. The fashionista is also a mother to her two other adult children — <a href=#>Tierra and Kaleigh</a>.</p><p>An interesting development could result in Shereé raising another baby after having three adult children.</p><p>So, is Shereé pregnant? Here’s the scoop on a possible baby no. 4!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Shereé Whitfield pregnant? Martell Holt, you are NOT the father!</h2><p>Shereé and Martell started dating in July 2022, following her split from Tyrone. At the time, fans warned the She by Shereé CEO about canoodling with the OWN star after his marriage to <a href=#>Melody Holt</a> ended in infidelity. Nonetheless, Shereé reminded us that no one was “gon’ check me boo” and continued flaunting her relationship on social media and her and Martell’s respective reality shows.</p><p>After a few episodes of parading her romance with Martell, Shereé hinted at a new development in the couple’s relationship. In a scene from Season 15, Ep. 4, “The Buck Stops in Birmingham,” Shereé brought cameras along for a doctor’s appointment.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>As her doctor performs an ultrasound, she asks Shereé if she’s “been trying” for a baby as the camera zooms in on the sonogram. Shereé then gives an entirely relatable response by asking her doc, “Trying for what??” The rest of the scene shows Shereé panicking (in full glam, of course) on the hospital bed.</p><p>Thankfully, most fans who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">follow Shereé on her socials</a> or have seen her frolicking around Atlanta know she isn't pregnant. While she and Martell are reportedly still together, it’s safe to say neither is ready to have a child together anytime soon.</p><p>On the show, Shereé has clarified that she’s only having fun with Martell, who has a bundle of his own kiddos. Before Melody filed for divorce in 2020, they welcomed four children — Maliah Selene, Mariah, Martell Jr., and Malani. Also, Martell has another child, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Knox</a>, from his <a href=#>extramarital affair with Arionne Curry</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=ht dir=ltr>Sheree might be pregnant?

Following the scene of Shereé at her doctor’s office, fans shared their hilarious doubts that Shereé could be pregnant.</p><p>Many felt RHOA producers were “trolling” all of us with the pregnancy scare because Shereé is over 50. Others saw the clip as their final straw and vowed to stop watching the long-running series altogether.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sheree is 53.

"She has the curliest hair, the best smile, and a happy baby. I'm excited when I see her, but she gets so excited when we see each other. It melts your heart!"</p><p>"It's been so special to have her in our family, and it gets more and more special every day as I watch her grow," she continued. "Just seeing the person she's becoming, how she reacts to me, the bond we're building ... it's just so cool. I love playing with her, reading, and taking her to the park. And it's funny because I get to say, 'Here you go, I'm tired now,' and hand her back. That's new for me!"</p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWmvsSeZKmqlZy7orrTZqmemZxitbDB0p6uoq6VqHqwsoyaq6WZnqmu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachel-bilson-relationship-history.html><span>←</span><span>Actress Rachel Bilson Opens up About Her Famous Exes on 'Broad Ideas'</span></a>
