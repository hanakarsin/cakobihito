I could drink any bottle under the table. It was because of peer group pressure. We enjoyed diverting ourselves alcoholically. We were not given to subduing the womenfolk as a mark of accomplishment; we always got together to drink and smoke cigarettes. As we got older, I felt there is a need to cut down on all these excesses. I gave up smoking though I smoked for 21 years. I gave it up when I discovered it wasn’t serving any purpose.</p><p>On how he now wards off anger after giving up smoking 21 years ago to manage his anger</p><p><strong>On if he is a fulfilled man</strong></p><p>Yes. What else am I going to ask from God? I have a brilliant wife and brilliant children. So, yes, I am (fulfilled).</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnqAk25loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./asuu-only-lecturers-on-ippis-would-get-salaries-buhari.html><span>←</span><span>Only Lecturers On IPPIS Would Get Salaries Buhari</span></a>
