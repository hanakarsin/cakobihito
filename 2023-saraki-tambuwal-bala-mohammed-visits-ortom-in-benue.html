We are here today as part of our ongoing consultation of three of us who have shown indication to aspire for the presidency under our great party.</p><p>“We, on our own about a couple of weeks ago felt that in the interest of our party as well in the interest of our great country we should be able to come together and find a consensus among us.</p><p>“Our interest is very little compared to our country’s at this time when it is in its very defining moment. I believe only our party can rescue this country from where it is today and those of us who are aspiring are committed to ensuring that we find somebody who will unite us whom we will all support. That’s a better way to unite the party and reduce the rancour in the process.</p><p>“To do that, we must also carry along with key stakeholders of the party, leaders in the party like you and that’s why we are here today. Three of us alone cannot win and deliver; it is all of us and that’s why we feel that at this very stage of our deliberation, leaders like you must be part of it. That’s why we held a private discussion for you to know that we are very serious about this.</p><p>“The seriousness comes from our total belief that it’s the unity of our party. All of us are eminently qualified to lead this country; it’s about us ensuring that we put the country first and that is why we are here.“</p><p>Saraki appreciated Ortom for welcoming them to the state, expressing confidence that the formation of the unity team is in the best interest of the PDP and Nigeria.</p><p>In his remarks, Ortom eulogised the trio for informing him of their presidential ambitions, describing all of them as eminently qualified to be the president of Nigeria.</p><p>He said: “These two leaders (Saraki and Tambuwal), Nigerians can testify that during their time that they did very well and delivered on their mandate, so I’m not surprised today they are coming out for the presidency.</p><p>“My brother, Mohammed, who we were colleagues together at the administration of President Good luck Jonathan, he is also eminently qualified and I’m very happy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5FxZmtoYmh6tK3RmqKiZaSWuqPB1pqjZpqRoa5uuc6hmKallZl6t7XSoqusZZ%2BnwbC5jKKlZpqVo8Kmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kirk-norcross-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kirk Norcross - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
