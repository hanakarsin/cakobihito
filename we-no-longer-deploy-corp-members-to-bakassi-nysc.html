We don’t intend to do so. We won’t also deploy any to other volatile communities.</p><p>“We have only four of them in Akpabuyo LGA which had cases of volatility. The four are serving with security agencies and are safe.</p><p>“Our zonal coordinators and inspectors are always at the ready in cases of emergencies to evacuate them.”</p><p>Speaking further, Andrew explained that they do not deploy those who do not like water to coastal places.</p><p>“We don’t compel them to go to riverine communities, especially those of them that have phobia for rivers”, he added.</p><p>He confirmed that many of the Akwa Ibom State corps members who were kidnapped enroute Sokoto State months ago for their national service, have been released alongside their driver.</p><p>He said only a few are yet to be released by the kidnappers.</p><p>“Many of the Corps members kidnapped near Sokoto are being released. Their driver has also been released. Only few of the Corps members are left with the kidnappers. The DG of the Scheme had to relocate from Abuja to Zamfara State.
