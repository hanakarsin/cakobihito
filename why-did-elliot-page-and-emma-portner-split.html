If that wasn't enough, both Elliot and Emma have removed most of the pics of each other from their Instagrams, which is telling because that's where they both announced their marriage."><meta name=author content="Enda Jantzen"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

"Trans, queer and non-binary people are a gift to this world. I also ask for patience & privacy but that you join me in the fervent support of trans life every single day. Elliot’s existence is a gift in and of itself. Shine on sweet E. Love you so much."</p><p>This breakup looks like it was a long time in the making. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a> reports that Elliot and Emma released a joint statement saying that they actually split last summer before Elliot announced his transition. "After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce following our separation last summer," the statement said in part. "We have the utmost respect for each other and remain close friends."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Emma has previously defended her sexuality and gender identity.</h2><p>After Elliot shared his gender identity, everyone on the internet felt the need to give their opinion on the matter. Part of that included people who were confronting Emma about her own sexuality. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Out Magazine</a>, one of the comments on Emma's supportive IG post said, “But now you know you have a husband,” said one hater on Portner’s Instagram post. “I hope you are not a lesbian.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Emma Portner (@emmaportner)</a></p></figure><p>But Emma wasn't having it. She reportedly commented back saying, "I hope you know my sexual preferences and gender identity are none of your business,” she wrote. “For me to decide, thank you. Release your labels of me. I am as fluid as can be."</p><p>Others posted negative comments as well, but some of Emma's fans jumped in the comments to defend her relationship with Elliot.&nbsp;</p><p>"Emma loves [Elliot] because he is Elliot,” someone commented. “Love is actually all that encompassing, and you seem like your life needs more of it."</p><p>In an Instagram Story, Emma also stated that her gender, sexuality, and pronouns are "private and not up for debate" before looking to delete her Instagram account.&nbsp;</p><p>"My gender identity, pronouns and sexuality are private and not up for debate," she said. "Would love for the energy in discussion over my identity to shift into addressing the climate crisis or sharing resources to LGBTQIA2+ resiliency instead."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2adnKG2sMCMqZignV2Wu6V5xKakmmWgpL%2B1usSrZKyonJ7B</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./douye-diri.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Douye Diri On Naija News</span></a>
