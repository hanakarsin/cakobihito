The source also alleged that one of the ex-presidents even requested for two SUVs, which the ONSA agreed to deliver.</p><p>The source said as reported in the newspaper, the former head of state told the former NSA to station one of the vehicles in Abuja, and the other in Lagos state, to ease his movement within the two cities. The source, however, declined to give the amount the exotic vehicles were purchased for the ex-presidents.</p><p><i>“What is coming will shock Nigerians and many of them will get to know if indeed Dasuki used the money to enrich himself as being bandied in many quarters. As a law-abiding NSA, he had to carry out the instructions handed over to him by the Presidency and nothing more.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Arms Purchase Case: Sambo Dasuki Is A Looter By Nature</p><p><i>“It is also instructive to note that those who are now blaming Dasuki for carrying out his assigned duties and calling for his head actually benefited immensely from the security vote, which was domiciled in his office. The truth of the matter is that all over the world security votes are used for various reasons to bring about national peace and stability and Dasuki could not have done otherwise,”</i> the source said.</p><p>In a related development, the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II has denied claims that he gave the office of the embattled former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki N40 billion in donations while he served as the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).</p><p>Iyorchia Ayu, a former senator of the federal republic, has recently explained that he collected the sum of N345 million from the former national security adviser, Sambo Dasuki, from the controversial arms deal being probed.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3eDkW5rZmpdZq9urdGmqmark5a7pa3LZpuaq6Wgtm6%2FxK1kp5mdmnqmxIypqZ6rmZmyr8DSZqmem5Wew6awjJ%2Bsp5yjY7W1ucs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-anna-paul-and-glen-break-up.html><span>←</span><span>Why Did Anna Paul and Glen Thomson Break up?
