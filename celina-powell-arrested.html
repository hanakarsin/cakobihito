After she received a verbal warning for the action, she was arrested for continuing to drive without a valid license.</p><p>In 2019, Celina opened up about her various issues with breaking the law in a vlog. She claimed that she first lost her license after evading the police years back, and that she hasn't been able to get it back due to other parole violations.</p><p>She confirmed her most recent arrest a day after it happened on her Twitter account.</p><p>"I went to jail again lmfao," she wrote on March 9.&nbsp;</p><p>She had previously been arrested for the same thing on New Year's Eve in 2020.
