While the VR headset is one of the more accessible ones out there, is there a way to connect it to your Nintendo Switch?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can you hook up the Oculus Quest 2 to the Nintendo Switch?</h2><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is, in our opinion, one of the best gaming headsets on the market. Not only does it provide one of the smoothest VR experiences to date, but you also don't necessarily need a gaming PC to get it to work. The headset comes equipped with a few games that you can launch to get a feel for the console's controls, and when coupled with a gaming PC, can be a great way to immerse yourself in a wide variety of games.</p><p>Unfortunately, though, there currently is no way for players to connect their Oculus Quest 2 headset to their Nintendo Switch. While there are a few workarounds that have been posted online, many of these require additional materials like capture cards, a powerful PC, and other supplies to make the two devices compatible.</p><p>If you're looking for a VR experience with your Nintendo Switch games, you won't be able to find it in the Oculus Quest 2 at this time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is there a VR headset that works with the Nintendo Switch?</h2><p>If you're hoping to have a VR experience on your Nintendo Switch, you'll have to invest in the company's Labo VR Starter Kit, which retails for $119.99.</p><p>The Labo kit includes the materials to build your own "Toy-Con VR goggles" and the "Toy-Con Blaster," and the kit is meant to be an entry point for VR experiences. Unfortunately, this is geared at the console's younger users, and considering the headset is a DIY project in itself, it can feel a bit silly to wear.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>There are, of course, other VR headset options that are compatible with the Switch that you can purchase, though as these are third-party accessories there may be some gaps in the compatibility between the pieces.</p><p>Each of these headsets involves putting the Nintendo Switch in a slot built into the headset, so really instead of an entirely separate internal screen, you're still using the Switch's screen to play the games.</p><p>Honestly, none of these VR experiences are ideal for an older audience, and while the Labo Starter Kit may be a good gift for the young gamer in your life, it's not best if you're grown and looking for an authentic VR experience while playing the Nintendo Switch.</p><p>At this time, the company has not announced any plans to bring a fully VR experience to the Switch, though with competitors like the Oculus Quest 2 and the upcoming <a href=#>PSVR2</a>, don't count Nintendo out just yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vediorGato5p6sK%2FUpaysZaGqsrTAjGtksKGknXqvtc2tnKecn2LAuLXTnJ8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./639675-burna-boy-south-african-rapper-aka-molested-club-patron-photos-html.html><span>←</span><span>Burna Boy, AKA Attacks Club Patron</span></a>
