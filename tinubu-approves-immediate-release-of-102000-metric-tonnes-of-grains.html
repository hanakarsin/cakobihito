Those who are responsible for producing this rice and we have asked them to open up their stores.</p><p>They’ve told us that they can guarantee about 60,000 metric tons of rice. This will be made available and we know that that is enough to take Nigerians the next one month to six weeks, perhaps up to two months.”</p><p>The minister revealed that the administration will resort to importing to augment any shortages observed after the release of the food items.</p><p>“Now, the third item is that government is also looking at the possibility, if it becomes absolutely necessary, as an interim measure in the short run to also import some of these commodities,” he added.</p><p>The minister, however, declined to mention specifics affirmed the government’s readiness to take punitive measures against those he called food hoarders.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze49xZq2hnqqvtnnAqaerp6aawG61zKacnaGRqbJuvsSlnJqrlWK8p3mQaWlpaGBiuqbA0aKaZqyfo7umv4yonWafopa2r7%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./october26-html.html><span>←</span><span>October 26 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</span></a>
