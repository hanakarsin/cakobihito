So I thought I was going to have a soft landing there. I packed up everything from Nigeria, bought a one-way ticket, and came to America.</p><p>“I was put in a well-furnished house and all of that. Then two days later, the person who I was supposed to book a deal with said to me, ‘Those our financiers have pulled out. They have an issue.’ So, I said, what do I do? He was like, ‘From next month on, you will have to start paying rent in this house.’ The amount of the one-month rent was equivalent to a one-year rent in Nigeria.</p><p>“I’m like, ‘I’m not earning any money so what do I do?’ I don’t know what to do. So, shot into that life, I had to figure out what to do. I had nowhere to go. Nothing to turn to. My phone was buzzing, like, ‘When are you coming back to Nigeria? We have this gig for you.’ Teju, $1,500 was all I came to America with. How do I buy a ticket to go back to Nigeria?</p><p>“My life pattern then was so disorganised in the sense that I didn’t have a proper saving culture. With all the money I was making in Nigeria, my life was a mess. I sold my cars and gave out like 90 per cent of all my belongings in Nigeria. I was like, I’m going to America to live a good life and all of that stuff. How do I buy a ticket to go back to Nigeria? Lord, what do I do? And God said to me that ‘Welcome to the life that I arranged for you. I needed to break you away from your comfort zone so that I can build you.’</p><p>“I was like, ‘No, no, no …’ He was like, ‘Yes, welcome to it. So, here you are, now way to earn a living. How do you move forward?’ Then, sometimes I will be in my room crying. I’m like, ‘Lord where do I go from here?’ And for some reason every month I get to pay the rent. I got connected to my church. And then someone gave me a car. I’m like, what do I do with the car? And they said Uber. I was driving for Uber and Lyft to pay my bills.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e49xZqmnoKq5or6Mp6alpKmsvLCwjJqaraeiYsG2vs2sZK6alad6pb7Ir5yrZZmjeqK5xKugnJldnLa3sdJmqZ6Zo6S7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-kara-and-lena-end-up-together.html><span>←</span><span>Do Kara and Lena End up Together in the Superhero Drama 'Supergirl'?</span></a>
