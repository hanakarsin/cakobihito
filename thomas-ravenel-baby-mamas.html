Who are these ladies and what’s their relationship to Thomas Ravenel now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Southern Charm’s Thomas Ravenel must be pretty charming to have two different baby mamas! Despite his drug and abuse allegations, the charming reality star and politician has graced our screens and stolen the hearts of two different women. Baby mama number one, Kathryn Dennis, and Thomas split in 2018 after having two children. Baby mama number two, Heather Mascoe, might still be with Thomas — let’s see what’s going on.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Thomas Ravenel and baby mama Kathryn Dennis had a tumultuous relationship.</h2><p>Thomas and his first baby mama, Kathryn Dennis, lived out their romance for all of us to see on Southern Charm. It was a rocky road of a relationship between the two, who had about a thirty year age difference. &nbsp;In the span of their on and off relationship, they had two children, Kensie, now 6, and Saint, now almost 5. Thomas shared humorously to the NY Post, “The joke my friend said [was], ‘Thomas has known Kathryn for three months and a day, and she’s been pregnant for 3 months."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I think the best part of being a Mama is when your lil ones look up at you and just smile or laugh because they know you are their person. Like nobody else is as important as you. They know that you have them like nobody else will. The connection is indescribable. This quarantine has really illuminated that for this lil Ma.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Kathryn Calhoun Dennis</a> (@kathryndennis) on Apr 18, 2020 at 6:07pm PDT</p></figure><p>After their second child, Saint, was born, Kathryn and Thomas called it quits. They said it was a long time coming, and between Thomas’s multiple sexual abuse allegations with both Dawn Ledwell, who's also been featured on Southern Charm as Kathryn and Thomas's nanny, and model Ashley Perkins’ mother, that seems like a fair call.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Thomas and Heather Mascoe have a very different story.</h2><p>While Thomas and Heather have also had an on and off relationship, their 19-year age difference is a step forward for Thomas. However, they also moved fairly quickly, and welcomed their first child on June 29 of this year. When their son, Jonathan Jackson Ravenel, was born, they actually were no longer together. It wasn’t a very long-lived relationship — reportedly, they were only really together in the summer of 2019.</p><p>While Heather is closer in age to Thomas, she also is not part of the reality-show family. Heather is a registered nurse, and has two kids of her own with her ex, Leo Chiagkouris. According to Us Weekly, Leo was not a fan of Thomas, and actually hung a banner of Thomas’s legal woes outside of his house! That’s quite the rivalry.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Meet Jonathan Jackson Ravenel.

Thomas tweeted, “Did anyone know I’m getting married?” on Tuesday, Oct. 13. The thread continued, “I’m getting engaged to marry Heather Mascoe. I’m a lucky man!”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>In teasers for Southern Charm Season 7, it looks like there may be a scene featuring Thomas, his new son, and maybe even his baby mama, Heather Mascoe, even though she's done a pretty decent job staying off our screens. Although, to be fair, Thomas had already been fired from Southern Charm by the time he started dating Heather. Regardless, the aforementioned thread is no longer on Twitter, so it’s anyone’s guess what the real story is!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWwucCsZKuZppq7priMm5ibsV2irq6t0g%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-wilkinson-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sam Wilkinson - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
