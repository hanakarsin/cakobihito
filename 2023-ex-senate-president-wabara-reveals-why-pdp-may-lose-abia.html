The Abia State PDP should learn from our national leadership and respect zoning. Our party shall not be doing the right thing at the centre and here somebody will be acting with impunity.</p><p>“No single person has the authority to decide the next governor of the state. The party caucus, elders and stakeholders will have to meet.</p><p>“Gov. Ikpeazu’s successor may be the governor’s choice but that should only happen after the right thing has been done in line with the constitution of our great party, which is macro zoning to Ukwa or Abia North.</p><p>“I am saying this because of my love for our great party, which of course enjoys large followership in Abia. But if the PDP leadership doesn’t do the right thing, the party will get protest vote in 2023.</p><p>“Abians will vote the PDP 85% but if the governorship ticket is not ceded to Ukwa or Abia North in line with power rotation arrangement, there will be a protest vote.</p><p>“Abia is not ready for Ngwa back to back thing. What they are doing now is exactly why the PDP lost Plateau State to the APC in 2015. Ukwa or Abia North should produce Ikpeazu’s successor.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5FrZmtoYmh6psSMrJynmaSaerG%2BxKygnZ2eqXq4rcGaqZploprDpq3LrGSwoKlivaW8jKaYsmWcpMCmecCboJpn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./titanic-sinclair-and-poppy-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Titanic Sinclair and Poppy's Relationship: An Explainer</span></a>
