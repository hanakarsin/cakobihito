Eurasia Group stated that Buhari’s victory would be possible by the intensity of supports for his candidature, lacklustre grassroots campaigning by the PDP and the anti-rigging measures put in place by the Independent National Electoral Commission.
According to the group, the APC flag bearer would record a 60% victory against his main rival, President Goodluck Jonathan, who is hoping for reelection."><meta name=author content="Almeda Bohannan"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
