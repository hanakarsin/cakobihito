Interestingly, the <i>Not Afraid</i> singer has been making headlines since the start of his illustrious career in 1988. Drug addiction, controversial lyrics, and Eminem's face pictures have been discussed in various news outlets.<strong></strong></p><h2>What happened to Eminem's face?</h2><p class=align-left>Every time there's a rare public sighting of Marshall "Eminem" Mathers, his fans are absolutely shocked by his appearance. The rapper appears to have matured a lot since his 1999 album, <i>The Slim Shady LP</i>. However, his drastic physical changes have made him nearly unrecognizable to his fans, prompting some to speculate about his overall well-being.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f3a30113f478899d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of all rappers who died in 2021: From DMX to Biz Markie</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2014, Eminem appeared haggard and gaunt when he spoke at the Wall Street Journal's Innovator of the Year awards in New York. His looks sparked a set of mixed reactions from his fans and followers. Some associated the appearance with past drug addiction, while others thought it was because of plastic surgery.</p><p class=align-left>So what are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">some possible explanations</a> for Eminem face evolution? Did he go for plastic surgery? This and many more are the cause of confusion among his fans and followers.</p><h3>Why Eminem facial hair drew attention</h3><p class=align-left>One main reason why the rapper's face appeared to have changed was because of facial hair. Since the start of his decades-long career, the <i>Love the Way You Lie </i>rapper had maintained a clean-shaven face. However, he joined the BeardGang and debuted his new, worn look on his Instagram account in 2017.</p><p class=align-left>In the photo, the singer posed alongside his colleagues Dr. Dre and breakout artist Kendrick Lamar. They captioned the picture with the words,</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/314b88bca0be5821.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 former Hollywood actors who went crazy in real life (and their whereabouts)</span></p></a>Just a couple of guys from Compton and one from Detroit. With a beard.<p class=align-left>The picture attracted numerous comments from his followers. Some detested his new rough and rugged look, while others adored it.</p><h3>Did Eminem undergo plastic surgery?</h3><p class=align-left>Plastic surgery rumours are not new to celebrities, especially in the <a href=#>entertainment</a> industry, where looks are essential. Nonetheless, most of them undergo the operation to keep their youthful appearance. But Eminem getting plastic surgery would be a surprise to many people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f3a30113f478899d.png><p class=align-left>Over the years, fans have witnessed a drastic change in his face. It appears different from his old face, which was becoming dull over time. His face is now stiff and even in texture.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Some fans suspected</a> that he had Botox injections in his face. Botox injection is a popular treatment known to make the face smooth and stiff. Judging from his appearance then, his forehead was looking like one made of porcelain which obviously is a sign of plastic surgery.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bd6aa5f5bddc05e3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How many tattoos does Joey Fatone have, and what do they mean?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite all the speculations, the American rapper remains undistracted. He has neither confirmed nor denied the plastic surgery rumours. Therefore, it is not easy to conclude that he has undergone the blade.</p><h3>Was Eminem's face change as a result of drug and substance abuse?</h3><p class=align-left>Prolonged use of drugs changes one's appearance. It is possible to identify an alcoholic and a tobacco or a bhang addict from the people you come across. There’s speculation that Eminem’s face-over is from years of drug abuse.</p><p class=align-left>Even though the singer does not look as horrible as others who have suffered from drug addiction, many think that his previous demons may have robbed him of his once-boyish appearance. The singer got hooked on prescription pills during the filming of his semi-biographical 2002 movie dubbed <i>8 Mile</i> after being given a sleeping pill to help him cope with the 16-hour days.</p><p class=align-left>In a documentary called <i>How To Make Money Selling Drugs</i>, the rapper admitted that he had almost died from an overdose before rehab in 2005. Some think that this could perhaps explain what happened to Eminem face. But it is unclear.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/75b6f0e087fffec0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 15 best white rappers of all time: Who ranks number 1?</span></p></a><h3>What does Eminem look like now?</h3><p class=align-left>The singer has maintained an incredibly good look with beards nowadays. As much as this new look has elicited a set of mixed reactions from his fans, he has remained unmoved. The early 2000s were Eminem's hay days, but the award-winning American rapper has still been active since then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/314b88bca0be5821.jpg><p class=align-left>In the past decade, he produced four albums, <i>Recovery, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, Revival,</i> and <i>Kamikaze</i> in 2018. In 2020, the singer and Kid Cudi released a single dubbed <i>The Adventures of Moon Man and Slim Shady.</i> This was the first time the two great rappers had joined forces.</p><p class=align-left>What stood out in the music was Eminem face mask lyrics. In what appeared as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a harch criticism</a> to those who do not wear face masks, the singer's lyrics read,</p>Bunch of halfwits up in the office. Half of us are walking around like a zombie apocalypse. The other half are just pissed off and don’t want to wear a mask, and they’re just scoffin’. And that’s how you end up catchin’ the sh*it off ’em.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/56b57511c8b74b1b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 meanest celebrities in real-life according to fans</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you have been wondering about what happened to Eminem's face, there you have it.
