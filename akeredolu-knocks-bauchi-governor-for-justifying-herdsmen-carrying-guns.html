We are persuaded to believe he didn’t make that statement.</p><p>“If, indeed, he made that statement and owns up to its contents, it then means that the Bauchi State governor has declared on behalf of the Federal Government, an executive order which now allows all Nigerians, herdsmen inclusive, to carry prohibited firearms like assault rifles for self-defence. That is exactly what the governor (Mohammed) has done and displayed by his conduct which brazenly depicts that whether other Nigerians like it or not, herdsmen must carry AK-47 for self-defence while other non-Fulani herdsmen must remain unarmed to be perpetual victims of arms-wielding bandits.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5BsZpqjlaeypbvLrmSkpp%2BYuLR5wZqsnKCZYrSwwsSrpaiqXZu8s3nJrqqtoZautq%2BzjKGcq5yjorKvecKaqauxmaO0brPUp6po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./425215-robert-burale-kenyan-parents-ezekiel-mutua-protecting-children-immoral-content-html.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Burale Says Kenyan Parents Miss Ezekiel Mutua for Protecting Children from Immoral Content</span></a>
