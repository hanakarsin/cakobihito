C. Agbala,</strong> said the support for the PDP was in the interest of the Igbo.</p><p>Agbala said, “We can no longer continue in opposition as a region; we have endured enough and must get our region back to national politics. You have our unalloyed support and blessings. With you, we are comfortable supporting (an) Atiku Abubakar’s presidency, knowing that you have a record of always standing in the line of progress, development, and stability.”</p><p>While addressing the monarchs, Okonkwo assured them that Atiku would restructure Nigeria if elected President in 2023.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reported earlier that the indecisiveness of the Rivers State Governor, <strong>Nyesom Wike,</strong> to declare his position ahead of the 2023 general elections had stirred a tense atmosphere in the political space of the state.</p><p>Supporters and members of the PDP in Rivers State in the camp of Governor Wike are yet to know the presidential candidate to support in 2023.</p><p>As Governor Wike is yet to state his position, his supporters don’t know if they should vote for PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku or any other presidential candidate.</p><p>Rivers State, in the last few months, has attracted attention following Governor Wike’s call that the National Chairman of PDP, Iyorchia Ayu should resign.</p><p>Wike had asked that a southerner should take over for equity and fairness in PDP ahead of the 2023 race.</p><p>Although Governor Wike has assured stakeholders in PDP that he would not dump the party, his comments recently cast doubts on the promise.</p><p>Recall that Governor Wike, during the inauguration of Rivers PDP campaign council, said people who disrespected the state does not deserve the vote of Rivers people.</p><p>Wike claimed that Atiku picked people from Rivers State as members of the Presidential Campaign Council without consulting him.</p><p>He further stated that the decision of Atiku shows that he does not want his support in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5JpZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm59lmaYp5mdl7%2BiecyopZqqk53AbrDUpqdmqJWpsrN5zpugZqyfYq%2Bir8pmmK2hm6p8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-peter-and-kelley-break-up.html><span>←</span><span>Why Did Peter Weber and Kelley Flanagan Break Up?
