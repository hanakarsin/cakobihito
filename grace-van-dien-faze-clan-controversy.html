Source: TwitchMassively-known organization FaZe Clan has been at the forefront of the esports sector for many years now. The collective has had its members reside in content houses amid playing at top-level competitions and building platforms around Call of Duty and other competitive franchises.
Last year, the organization's board of directors saw some shake-up by adding iconic rapper Snoop Dogg before his departure this April — speculated as an effect of FaZe Clan's spiraling financial troubles."><meta name=author content="Enda Jantzen"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Grace later snapped back on this comment:</p><p>"I'm sorry, sir, were you in the meeting with us? Were you there?" She said during a stream. "No, I've never f--king met you, and that is not why FaZe signed me ... So, get f--king wrecked to everyone saying that, to Rain saying that."</p><p>On May 28, Rain <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">called</a> Grace "mid," effectively telling his viewers she was mediocre, which he later backtracked since he felt bad about saying it. That prompted Grace to reply with a shocking statement about Rain's drug history.</p><p>She brought up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rain's past overdose</a> in a clip, adding more fuel to the back-and-forth.</p><p>Both members aimed to settle their issues by meeting in person on May 30 and recording the discussion as proof but instead made matters even uglier.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Against Grace's wishes, Rain posted the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> and reacted to the discussion, where Grace criticized old misogynistic tweets from Rain and his treatment toward her since joining.</p><p>Rain argued he was being "nice, respectful, and understanding" throughout the video and didn't "mean no harm, and it's literally just jokes on the internet."</p><p>Later, Grace started crying and left the room and stated she would leave FaZe Clan if the video got uploaded.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">FaZe Clan issues a public statement to defend Grace.</h2><p>In response to the video, FaZe Clan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a public statement</a> on May 31 that "the mistreatment of our newest member is in no way OK. Grace joined in hopes to bring her voice to FaZe & we stand by her."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>FaZe is no stranger to contrasting viewpoints and passionate opinions on the future of the brand.
