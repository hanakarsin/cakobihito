One of them is this: we care about you for the simple fact that you are a person, our neighbor on planet earth. It’s not about what color your skin is, how much money you have in the bank, your political affiliation, sexual orientation, gender, nationality or faith,” he wrote. “That’s all fascinating, but it cannot add or take away from the reality that we’re already pulling for you.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Joanna said that shies away from religion.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joanna Stevens Gaines (@joannagaines)</a></p></figure><p>This March, Joanna and Chip talked to Oprah Winfrey about religion and faith on the talk show host’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Soul TV show and podcast</a> this March.</p><p>“With the idea of religion, I shy away from that,” Joanna said at the time. “My relationship with God, it’s like no one else’s,” the 42-year-old explained. “God is so creative that I can’t impose [that] my belief and my relationship that I have with him should be like Chip’s or should be like yours. He shows up in beautiful unique ways for all of us.”</p><p>For his part, Chip explained that he has spiritual moments through chopping firewood or doing demo work when he’s feeling emotional. “And I think God meets me in those very childlike, very natural, very simple ways,” he added.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The couple’s recent political donation also churned controversy.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>TV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines donate to campaign against critical race theory in schools <a href=#>https://t.co/HzpFTm1vxs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8rOiF8gm0k</a></p>— The Hill (@thehill) <a href=#>May 25, 2021</a></figure><p>Chip and Joanna avoid talking about politics, but this May, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dallas Morning News</a> reported that the couple had donated $1,000 to the campaign of Chip’s sister, Shannon Braun, who was running for a local school board.
