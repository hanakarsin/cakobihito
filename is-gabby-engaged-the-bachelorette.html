Many eagle-eyed fans noticed Erich hadn't been attending the live shows (though he showed support for the 31-year-old former ICU nurse on social media), and they were worried the adorable couple had called things off.</p><p>"I think life is just really busy for the both of us right now," Gabby told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>. "So, I understand their concern, but we're just kinda, you know, going forward with each of our individual interests and supporting each other from afar."</p><p>Just a few days later, news broke that Gabby and Erich had officially ended their engagement.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Erich Schwer (@erich_schwer)</a></p></figure><p>On Nov. 4, 2022, a source confirmed their break up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>, stating that Gabby was the one who broke things off earlier in the week. The insider noted that Gabby "felt they weren't aligned and weren't on the same page," adding that she was "hoping they could give each other space and work it out but ultimately decided they didn't have a future."</p><p>Many fellow franchise alums addressed Gabby and Erich's breakup, with Jill Chin telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> that "there had been the writing on the wall." Johnny DePhillipo, who dated Gabby on her season before joining Season 8 of <a href=#>BIP</a>, also spoke with Us Weekly and said, "It's rough. … I do love her, and I wish her all the best. It’s hard to go through these things."</p><p>For those unaware, Gabby and Erich are the fourth Bachelor couple affected by the DWTS curse.</p><p>OK, we know you're probably wondering what that means, so according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Steve</a>, all franchise leads who went on DWTS immediately after their season ended have split from their winner. Other couples affected by the curse include <a href=#>Jake Pavelka</a> and Vienna Girardi, <a href=#>Chris Soules</a> and Whitney Bischoff, and <a href=#>Nick Viall</a> and Vanessa Grimaldi.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jesse Palmer revealed Gabby and Erich are trying to "work through things."</h2><p>Although we're all devastated over Gabby and Erich's breakup, it seems no one is as upset as franchise host Jesse Palmer.
