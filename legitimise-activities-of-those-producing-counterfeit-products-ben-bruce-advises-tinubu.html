Rather than stigmatize them wouldn’t it be more beneficial to legitimize their skills and expertise? After all if we can allocate funds to train former Boko Haram members, why not invest in helping these individuals establish their own patent and business by providing grants to register their companies and set up legitimate factories, this way we will empower them to manufacture authentic, locally made pharmaceutical, food beverages, electronic and fashion brands under the made in Nigeria label,” Bruce said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye49wZqWdl57BqrnIrJxmmZOptre106KcrGWfm3q1tM6snGaooqSxtq%2FIp55mm5%2Bqu7Wx0Z%2Bcoqxdpb%2BwsNScq6xlkpq7bq7RrpqeZZGZw6q%2FxKxkraGeqq%2B2ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1147918-latest-weavon-fixing-styles-nigeria-html.html><span>←</span><span>Latest weavon fixing styles in Nigeria</span></a>
