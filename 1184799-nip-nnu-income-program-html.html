Their particular focus is on young people, students and members of the middle class who are looking for some passive monthly income.</p><p class=align-left>NIP has two divisions:</p><ul><li><strong>NARS </strong>(stands for NNU Ad Revenue Sharing) allows participants to earn residual income by simply logging into their accounts on the daily basis, leaving comments, reading news, posting in forum topics or sharing specific sponsored posts on their social media. NNU shares their monthly ad revenue with people who participate.</li><li><strong>NAP</strong> (stands for NNU Affiliate Program) recognises all the approved registered accounts as affiliates, allowing their owners to earn 62.5% commission on referral. So if someone uses your referral link to register on the website, you will receive 62.5%, which is actually ₦1,000 (registration costs ₦1,600).</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4bb6e0e1eb2b41d7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>MTN announces compensation to 77m subscribers for network outage, as CEO apologises again</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4bb6e0e1eb2b41d7.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Online survey jobs in Nigeria in 2018</p><p class=align-left>Thus, if you have a lot of friends, at least on the Internet, you can capitalise on that by offering them an opportunity to earn a passive income, at the same time profiting off them. That said, NNU claim that this opportunity is not for just anyone, as only people who have a positive mindset and an entrepreneurial spirit can make it.</p><p class=align-left>Now, does this sound like a pyramid scheme? Yes, it does. However, we have not been able to find any proof that this is indeed a scam. Therefore, we advise you to proceed with caution, if you decide to. Nevertheless, the payment seems to be a once-only thing.</p><h2>How does NIP work?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1mqu0fq2hde8.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Paga agent commission structure</p><p class=align-left>Ok, so while there are two divisions and all that, you have the opportunity to enjoy the best of both worlds, for ₦1,600 you purchase both packs. We have already explained how the referral system works, so now it is time to explain how you can get paid for everything else.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/9d937057a9a1d1a1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Doyin Okupe asks #EndSARS protesters to negotiate with FG</span></p></a><p class=align-left>First of all, you can get ₦50+ every day for simply logging in and browsing the website. Then, if you are feeling slightly more active, you can view some forum posts and leave comments for ₦2+ a pop. The plus signs mean that you will earn at least ₦50 and ₦2 respectively, but if the daily revenue of the website exceeds expectations, you can receive more than that.</p><p class=align-left>In addition to being an active reader, you can also earn money by being an active writer. For every relevant and well-structured forum topic, you can receive ₦100, provided it is approved. The same price tag is on the sponsored posts that can be found on the dashboard. For sharing said post on Twitter, Facebook, etc., you can get ₦100.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3qd49o1404bg.jpeg><p class=align-left>Now, if you think that you can just share the post and delete it as soon as possible, that is not how it works. On payday, your timeline will be reviewed, and if the post is not there, you can kiss your money goodbye (at least the money you could have earned for sharing sponsored posts).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/e763036012b6bab0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover how to play and win with NaijaBet</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But how can you get your money from all this? Well, the payment is disbursed on a monthly basis, and it is usually by the end of the month (27-31st of every month). During registration, you need to provide your bank details, and by the 25th of each month, you have to make a withdrawal request. That is how you can get your earnings.</p><p class=align-left>That said, you cannot withdraw money if your earnings for the month are less than ₦5,000. Even then, there is actually no guarantee that you will get your money by the end of the month. In their FAQ section, NNU mention that sometimes the ad revenue is not enough to pay everyone, which is why the payments might be transferred to next month. However, who’s to say that it will be enough next month?</p><h2>NNU registration process</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/9d937057a9a1d1a1.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 10 online jobs for students in Nigeria</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5dd7b7a6f16d66a1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to register for NHIS in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Registering on nnu.ng is surprisingly simple. You just have to go to nnu.ng/create-account and fill in the form. If you have been referred, do not forget to write their referral link.</p><p class=align-left>When you get to the payment method, here is where you need to make a decision. You can pay via either Paystack or Coupon. Paystack means that you can pay online with your card with no delays and with instant approval. Alternatively, you can get coupons from one of the coupon distributors, whose phone numbers can be found on the website.</p><p class=align-left>Once you register and pay, you need to wait for your account’s approval. After you have been approved, you can add more information to your account and start earning your money!
