This was done out of budgetary allocation to agriculture, and not with any palliatives fund.</p><p>“The news story circulating online, claiming that Governor Chukwuma Charles Soludo, CFR, utilized part of the state’s palliative funds to procure 800 tractors, which were subsequently distributed to farmers free of charge is fake.</p><p>“The administration operates within the bounds of fiscal responsibility and prudent financial management.
