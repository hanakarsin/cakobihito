"As you guys know, I’ve done almost nine years of my life in prison and a lot of that was on lockdown, so I’m just trying to stay busy. The stuff I used to do in prison was write letters, stay on the phone, draw, work out — work[ing] out was really important to keep your sanity."</p><p>He added, "Just [try] to do the best with this lockdown, guys. I hope you guys are staying sane."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Andrea and Lamar have also been documenting their quarantine — and Day 1 looks a lot different from Day 37. Andrea confesses she "was all up on" her husband in the beginning, even telling the camera, "I just hope I inspire other relationships."</p><p>But a month later, she says, "I just wanna kill him." In a parody video shared on Love After Lockup's official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook page</a>, Andrea is seen shouting, "You f--ked up my life, my kid’s life, and you just do this s--t to me. Get the f--k away from me. Get outta here." We hope that's not how the duo's isolation is really going.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoydpp6rXaG2p7GMmp2tnaJiubCvyq6nZpuforJuu80%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oscar-lloyd-html.html><span>←</span><span>Oscar Lloyd - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
