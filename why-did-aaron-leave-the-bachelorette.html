The question remains: What prompted his sudden departure?</p><p>Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: (Disney/John Fleenor</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Aaron leave 'The Bachelorette'?</h2><p>In Episode 3, Aaron receives a call from the U.S. Air Force offering him the chance to begin flight training back home. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity leads him to ponder whether he should leave the show or stick it out for our leading lady, <a href=#>Jenn Tran</a>.</p><p>After not receiving the group date rose, Aaron starts to question whether he and Jenn have a future together. So, ahead of the third rose ceremony, Aaron pulls Jenn aside and lets her know he's leaving to pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a fighter pilot.</p><p>"I wish I was further along, where I felt like, 'As long as I have Jenn in my life, I'm happy.' And I'm just not there yet," Aaron explains to Jenn, who is very understanding and reveals she would make the same choice if in his position.</p><p>The breakup appears mature and amicable at first, but there's a shocking twist! Just before leaving, Aaron warns Jenn about certain contestants not being ready for an engagement and others having questionable intentions. He refuses to name names, which Jenn feels is "not fair" — and we couldn't agree more!</p><p>"I feel like it was a disingenuous conversation," she says in a confessional. "I feel like he knew he wanted to leave, which is fine, but to not tell me who these people are ... that's cruel."</p><p>The Bachelorette airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC. Stream the next day on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aZkae8r3nLnpivnV2ptaZ5wZqaoZ2cpL%2BmwNOe</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whoopi-goldberg-star-trek-picard-season-2.html><span>←</span><span>Whoopi Goldberg Makes an Auspicious Return in 'Star Trek: Picard'</span></a>
