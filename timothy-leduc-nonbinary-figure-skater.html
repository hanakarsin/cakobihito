Source: NBC SportsIf you don’t know nonbinary figure skater Timothy LeDuc by now, it’s time to get acquainted. The 31-year-old made history in January when they became the first publicly-out nonbinary athlete competing in an Olympic Winter Games, as CNN reported at the time.
“My hope is that when people see my story, it isn’t focused on me and saying, ‘Oh, Timothy is the first out non-binary person to achieve this level of success in sport,’” Timothy said a press conference last month, per NBC Sports."><meta name=author content="Lourie Helzer"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In December, the Biden administration announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Olympics over the People’s Republic of China’s “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang,” as White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said at the time</a>.</p><p>Talking to reporters last month, Timothy acknowledged the “horrifying things that we’ve seen happening” to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uyghur people</a> in China, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>.</p><p>“I read somewhere the other day that it’s the largest number of people held in internment and labor camps since World War II,” they added. “I mean, these are horrifying human rights abuses that we’re seeing happening. And it can feel very powerless when you read those things, because you think, ‘What can I do?’”</p><p>Timothy said they also see human rights violations in the United States, too, as Americans are denied access to healthcare and abortion rights are under attack. “I feel powerless sometimes, seeing the situation in China,” they said. “I can use my voice here, yes. But what I can do here to defend human rights is be sure that I am vigilant and vote for the people in my local communities and state and local elections to defend human rights here as well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbauu9OhsGaklZnCpHnNqKWboZ6Wv7p5xaKerqqVYsCsrdOeqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nessie-kp-beef-black-ink-crew.html><span>←</span><span>Nessie and KP Have Declared a Truce on 'Black Ink Crew: Compton' (EXCLUSIVE CLIP)</span></a>
