This one, located in Pittsburgh, PA, is no exception. The photos from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zillow listing</a> for this house were posted to Twitter by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@frazierapproves</a>, where they went totally viral. You're about to see why.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>From the outside, this house looks very unassuming. They always do. "I just discovered the greatest house listing of all time," @frazierapproves wrote on Twitter. You'd never know what's to come by looking at this picture.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>When you see the yard, you think, according to @frazierapproves, "Wow, that's somewhat surprising." And sure. This picture is not exactly what I expected from looking at the front of the house. For one, there's a lot of fencing. A lot of it. And those windows! It looks more like an apartment building for seniors than a single family home.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>The whole pool situation is a little confusing. It looks like an above-ground pool, but it appears to be almost on the same level of the ground. Still, odd as that is, it's relatively normal.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>But then we get inside. The decor is certainly something. I have to say, when I looked at that modest brick Pittsburgh house, I didn't think, "Hm, I bet the interior is filled to the brim with dead animal skins and a spiral staircase." But here we are.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>And yes, that spiral staircase seems to lead to a small upstairs balcony full of books and gargoyle statues. That space-themed wall might seem out of place now, but wait until you see the dining room.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>OK, we've done it. We've officially crossed the realm into the weird. Why does this room exist? Where is it in relation to the animal skin rooms? These are questions that I cannot answer.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>They include a picture of the same room from a different angle, as if you will see this and say, "Ah yes, now I get it." But it still makes no sense.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>The Zillow description is amazing because it tries so hard to tie all the rooms in the house together. "Enter the door to a 13th-century castle decor sunken living room with dramatic, high, oak-beamed ceilings, hardwood floor, brick fireplace, a ladder to an elevated library. Time travel at warp speed to the 25th-century starship. A talking space alien greets you as you walk toward the floor-to-ceiling outer space wall mural."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>It continues, "The dining room command center rear wall opens up to the spaceship main bridge, working computer and controls from an Apache helicopter, speakers, and a 55-inch screen (TV works). Even though the listing agent worked hard to connect the 13th-century castle to the 25th-century spaceship deck, there was little he could do to make sense of the rooms that come next.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>That, my friends, is a "tropical island themed" bedroom, aka a bedroom with a floor completely full of sand. Hypothetical question: What if you... don't want this? Can you vacuum up all that sand? How do you get it out of the house? I have a feeling you don't.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Zillow</a></figure><p>This monstrosity of a house can be yours for just $159,900, which isn't bad if you, you know, want to live in a 1,075 sq. ft house whose decor manages to span an entire millennium.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmL%2Bixthmn6ito5p6rbXSraCnnw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stop-giving-excuses-to-justify-failure-of-governance-can-slams-buhari-security-agents.html><span>←</span><span>Stop Giving Excuses To Justify Failure Of Governance</span></a>
