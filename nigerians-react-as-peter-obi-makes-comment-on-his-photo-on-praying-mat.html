It didn’t emanate from my campaign team. I have deep respect for the Muslim faith and indeed, for every other religion. We will never mock any faith, ethnicity or gender. We are one Nigeria. -PO” He wrote</p><p>See some reactions that follow below:</p><p>Reacting, popular journalist,&nbsp;David Hundeyin [@DavidHundeyin] said Obi should stop trying to play the defensive game when he should be on the offensive.</p><p>He tweeted: “Dear PO, please stop apologising on behalf of your base. You are playing defence when you should be playing offence.</p><p>“Less “it wasn’t me,” more campaigning, please. This is a non-issue.”</p><p>Another netizen [@von_Bismack] wrote: “Always apologizing for nothing, abeg rest. People did something out of the abundance of their heart, if the effort can’t be appreciated, then good and fine. All these apologies will only weaken the zeal of the people that support you.”</p><p>On his part, Kelechi Ojinnaka [@orbiterP] admonished Obi to hire some experts to handle his campaign to avoid getting more backlash. He said: “Obama had a unit in the campaign HQ that supervised & trained volunteer groups. Bring some organization & structure to your campaign sir. The idea of unskilled & untrained volunteers running around the place is not good. A volunteer-first strategy isn’t it.”</p><p>Not supporting Obi’s presidential bid for 2023, a netizen Abefe [@abefe012] wrote: “With due respect sir! Wait until 2027 or 2031.</p><p>He never reach your turn. Focus on your business and do not forget that next cash and carry need to be rebuild. I can’t afford to be going shop rite every time.”</p><p>Speaking on other matters, a netizen Chukwu Timothy Chukwuebuka [@Timotech1820] suggest to the presidential hopeful saying: “Sir I think it’s time to unite your supporters.</p><p>“Create a general telegram group where all your supporters can get information direct from the campaign team. Then 712 groups will be created for all local govt in Nigeria. Where they can meet and discuss how to deliver their own LGA.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49qZqehl5q%2Fqq3NrGSrnZGYwW6t0mannqyVp3qwrshmpJqjlah6pLvMppynrF2ku260yKxkqaCfqbxuu81mp6uZqZ67qHnMmqto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ig-model-cocaine-ship.html><span>←</span><span>Instagram Models Caught Smuggling Kilos of Cocaine on Cruise Ship</span></a>
