His younger brother Bartholomew Owoh was publicly killed together with two other young men, for a crime related to using forbidden substances, which they did not foresee the death penalty. Nkem Owoh still mourns his brother because he was only 26 years old when he was killed. He says that he will never forgive the government for doing this to his younger brother.</p><p class=align-left>Many people think that Nkem Owoh is married to the famous actress Chinwe Owoh. However, this is a misconception, and they are not husband and wife. According to Nkem, they are in-laws. However, he refused to give a lot of information on their family ties because they want to protect their families from the media attention. This is a respectable decision because media always want to create more rumours.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c1d49c23396bf7b1.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Dana Kinduryte: the untold story of actor Jim Iyke's ex-wife</span></p></a><h2>Nkem Owoh wife and children</h2><p class=align-left>It is known that the real wife of Nkem Owoh prefers to stay away from the public attention. Her name is Ngozi Nkem Owoh, and not much is known about her, except the fact that the couple has two beautiful daughters. Nkem and Ngozi got married in 1998, and they are still together and in love. Nkem Owoh wife always supports her husband in whatever he does. As Nkem Owoh says, he travels around the world a lot, but Ngozi is always understanding and sensible towards him. She appreciates that he is the main source of money in the family, and does not mind that he is often away. However, the whole family spends as much time as they can together when Nkem has free time.</p><p class=align-left>As for Nkem Owoh daughters, he kept them away from the media eye for many years. He preferred for them to lead a normal life and not always be in the objectives of the cameras. Therefore, their names and occupations are also unknown to the broad public. However, there was one time when he decided to bring his two daughters along with him to the business event, which was held to renew his endorsement deal with MTN. This caused a lot of surprise among the fans. His daughters looked great, and everyone could make sure that Nkem Owoh and his wife have really good genetics.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7m01tjlg8k9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jim Iyke's biography: top facts you should know</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt57iva053fk7.jpg><p class=align-left>Nkem Owoh is an accomplished Nollywood superstar.
