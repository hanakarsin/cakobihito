But is the brunette beauty getting played by the controversial fitness trainer? Here’s what we know about their "showmance."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jack and Analyse had sex on Big Brother.</h2><p>Analyse <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed the hookup</a> in a conversation with fellow houseguests <a href=#>Christie Murphy</a> and <a href=#>Holly Allen</a>. "His d--k is huge. I’ve never experienced a d--k that big before," the 22-year-old admitted.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter/@hamsterwatch</span></figure><p>When word got around that the duo spent the night together, Analyse <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">defended her actions</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"At the end of the day, people need to worry about themselves and who they are sleeping with, and I will worry about myself and who I want to f--king sleep with. I’m 22 years old. I can sleep with whoever the f--k I want…" she declared.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jack proves he has no allegiance to Analyse.&nbsp;</h2><p>Despite getting intimate with the college soccer star, Jack made it clear that he considers Christie to be his partner in the competition.&nbsp;</p><p>"I would literally lay on a burning fire for you, and I would not do that for [Analyse]," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told</a> the blonde boutique owner. "America is going to hate me but you are my counterpart in this game."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Some fans are petitioning to have Jack ejected from the Big Brother house.</h2><p>Given that America already hates the Jason Momoa lookalike, we’re not at all surprised by his shady behavior in the last episode.</p><p>Over 4,700 people have signed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org</a> petition calling for CBS to remove the 28-year-old from Season 21 after <a href=#>he made racist comments</a> about black contestant Kemi Fakunle.</p><p>"F--king Kemi makes me want to f--king stomp a mud hole right through her chest," Jack was overheard saying on a live feed. In a separate incident, cameras were forced to cut away when the Tampa resident launched into another rant about the marketing strategist.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>"It’s like, b---h you’re f--king going up and you can play for your veto, but I’m gonna f--k you up. God, dude, she gets me so hyped! I f--king hate…" he started to say before the feed abruptly switched to a different room.</p><p>Jack has also made inappropriate remarks about contestant Jessica Milagros, a Latina plus-sized model. "I flirt with her just to make her feel good about herself," he commented while also referring to her as "Consuela" on various occasions.</p><p>After entertainment outlets began reporting on the CrossFit enthusiast’s ignorant statements, it appears that producers warned Jack about his behavior. "They're taking it out of context. I just need to be careful what I say," he reportedly told houseguest Tommy Bracco during a live feed.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a feeling Analyse will be horrified to hear about Jack’s conduct when she eventually leaves the house.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch new episodes of Big Brother three days a week on CBS and catch the 24/7 live feeds on CBS All Access.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66kt4yapZ1lkaOurcXSnmSboZdir7O706Gcqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-elections-dino-melaye-issues-advise-to-nigerians.html><span>←</span><span>Dino Melaye Issues Advise To Nigerians</span></a>
