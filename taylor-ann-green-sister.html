Andy wondered.</p><p>"Her sister's sick at the moment," Shep said. "And she loves Austen a whole lot, Taylor does."</p><p>Taylor soon returned to the couch, and she reiterated what Shep said.</p><p>"My sister is going through cancer, so losing a sister, I cannot imagine," Taylor said.

"Truly F you cancer. As incredibly disheartening news as this can be, my sister is not faint of heart and is ready to face this challenge again.
