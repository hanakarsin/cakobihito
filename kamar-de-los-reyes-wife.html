She of course played Kerri Reynolds from 1999–2002.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kamar took on the role of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Antonio Vega</a> from 1995–2009. So, their time on the soap opera would have overlapped, and the set is where the couple presumably met and fell in love.</p><p>Not too much is known about them, other than that they said "I do" in 2007 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lived in Los Angeles</a>. Kamar and Sherri share two sons (more about them in a moment).</p><p>Meanwhile, Sherri's Instagram mostly focuses on her career, but once in a while, she shares photos of her family, including a post that praised her husband for his most important role as a dad.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by 𝚂𝚑𝚎𝚛𝚛𝚒 𝚂𝚊𝚞𝚖 (@saumdays)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kamar de los Reyes had three kids, including twin sons.</h2><p>The beloved actor is not only survived by his wife, but by their two young children: 9-year-old twins Michael and John.</p><p>He also had an older son, Caylen, age 26, from a previous relationship.</p><p>Fans stepped up to support the mom and her children in light of their very sad loss, with one person commenting on Sherri's most recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post, "We love you, sending love and prayers to you and your kids."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kamar de los Reyes (@delosreyeskamar)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kamar de los Reyes also left behind a substantial net worth.</h2><p>As fans mourn the loss of the soap and video game star, and send their thoughts and prayers to his wife and kids, some also can't help but wonder what kind of net worth Kamar may have amassed over the course of his memorable career.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Kamar counted $3 million as his fortune before his truly tragic death at a very young age. He had been a working actor for decades before he went from the small to the big screen and starred in movies like Nixon and Salt.</p><p>The last project he completed was in 2023 on the show <a href=#>All American</a>, playing Coach Montes.</p><p>The good news is that Sherri is rumored to also be rather well off, having earned a net worth of as much as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6 million</a> herself at the time of writing.</p><p>She is a working actor who also notably starred on the show The Fosters, and Locke & Key, as well as the miniseries Mrs. Davis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK6urdFmm55lnKTAbr7EspysZaees6Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pounds-to-naira-exchange-rate-black-market-rate-today-21-february-2022.html><span>←</span><span>Pounds To Naira Exchange Rate/Black Market Rate Today 21 February 2022</span></a>
