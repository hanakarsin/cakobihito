When Bebe Cool finished high school, he joined Makerere College School; a co-educational government-aided O and A Level School founded in 1945 by Makerere University.</p><p class=align-left>Despite enrolling at Makerere College School, he did not graduate. Instead, he dropped out of college one year before completing his studies. Soon afterwards, he followed his passion of becoming a musician.</p><h3>Professional career</h3><p class=align-left>Bebe Cool has been in the entertainment industry for over two decades. Within that period, he has transitioned from being a singer-songwriter to an artist, record producer, <a href=#>actor</a>, and philanthropist.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/92e3f5748929826d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Iyaz: nationality, net worth, height, family, and songs</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/22f9df287e870eb9.jpeg><p class=align-left>When did Bebe Cool start singing?
