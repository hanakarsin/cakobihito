Sharina attended school in South Carolina before moving to New Jersey to pursue her modelling career.</p><h2>Motherhood</h2><p class=align-left>Sharina Hudson’s pregnancy was one of the biggest stories in the USA entertainment scene. At first, the story that Kevin Hunter’s lover was pregnant was a rumour. Wendy Williams even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">joked about the news</a> on her show.</p><p class=align-left>After Wendy Williams joke, the couple deleted their social media pages. However, Tasha K, a popular YouTuber, shared more about the family and the child in a viral video. Neither Kevin Hunter nor Sharina has come out to deny the YouTuber’s claims.</p><p class=align-left>In one of the most-watched videos on her channel, Tasha K shared the baby’s name.

However, it is the Sharina Hudson pictures showing her pregnancy bump that led to the couple divorcing.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Sierra Capri bio - Ethnicity, height, siblings, boyfriend</p><h2>Sharina Hudson interactions and relations</h2><p class=align-left>Apart from being a professional massage therapist, Sharina Hudson is famous because of her interactions with different people. Some of the interactions that have shaped her life include:</p><h3>Her relationship with Kevin Hunter</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6a734396864582ea.jpeg><p class=align-left>The first time Wendy Williams husband and Sharina Hudson met was in the company of Charlamagne Tha God. Kevin Hunter <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">acknowledged</a> that the radio host introduced Sharina to him to assist her with her modelling career.</p><p class=align-left>Though they did not go to that career direction, they have worked together since then. Hunter’s ex-wife pointed out that the affair started immediately — although she did not know about it until later.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f667f7dc5a0265c9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lia Marie Johnson: net worth, manager, songs, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For more than a decade, Kevin hunter and Sharina Hudson kept their affair away from the public. After photos surfaced online about the two having a romantic relationship, Wendy Williams <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">acknowledged seeing the images</a>.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Bucks owner daughter, Mallory Edens bio: Boyfriend, net worth, education, photos</p><p class=align-left>However, she took a different turn. Wendy Williams defended her then-husband. Her stand was a shock to many people, especially her fans. Unfortunately, Wendy’s defence on her husband was short-lived.</p><p class=align-left>In 2019, Wendy filed a divorce after pregnancy pictures surfaced. It is correct to state that the Sharina Hudson baby forced Wendy Williams to make the hard decision — initiate a process to dissolve her 22 years marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b00559c9e22eb964.jpeg><h3>Charlamagne relationship with Sharina Hudson and Kevin Hunter</h3><p class=align-left>Charlamagne Tha God's is a crucial figure in the life of Sharina Hudson because of two reasons. First, they grew up together in South Carolina. Therefore, Sharina Hudson and Charlamagne have a different type of bond.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bb5a5f13daa86965.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>MSNBC's Tamron Hall: husband, children, parents, ethnicity, siblings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, Charlamagne and Kevin Hunter (Sharina husband) have been friends for decades, thanks to their shared interest in the entertainment industry. As a talent manager, Kevin Hunter has been instrumental in Charlamagne's career in radio. For example, Hunter facilitated his relocation to New York. Since the two entertainment bigwigs are no longer in good terms, there have been different accounts on the cause of their disagreement.</p><p class=align-left>While Hunter initially insisted that the fallout was work-related, Charlamagne has maintained a different version of what happened between them. According to him, the reason why Hunter (and to an extent Wendy Williams) fell out was because of his friendship with Sharina.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Tom MacDonald biography and net worth</p><p class=align-left>Charlamagne, in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Page Six</a>, disclosed that Kevin thought that he was hooking up his mistress to other women. This perception created bad blood between him and his business associate and Wendy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/04b2eb22ed8c0c79.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Anna Woolhouse's age, married, boxing, career, family, facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since then, Hunter has tried to give another version of the story. Speaking to a popular YouTuber, Tasha K, the talent manager, pointed out that Charlamagne was not telling the truth. He believes that the radio host wanted to date his mistress — Hudson.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>While the world only knows about her relationship with Kevin Hunter, Sharina was doing different things. Some of the things she has done in regards to career include:</p><h3>Sharina Hudson as a model</h3><p class=align-left>The primary reason why Charlamagne introduced her to Hunter was modelling. The young Sharina was a model, and she hoped Hunter would mentor and manage her. While she never landed on a major modelling gig, Sharina was beautiful — according to Charlamagne.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0ccff2b3dc589235.jpeg><h3>Sharina as a massage therapist</h3><p class=align-left>In the past decade, Sharina Hudson has worked in Hollywood as a massage therapist.

Wendy believes that it was during her joint projects with her ex-husband when the affair started.</p><h2>Sharina Hudson net worth and income</h2><p class=align-left>Before her relationship with Kevin Hunter, Sharina was a model. While her modelling career did not take off, she became a massage therapist in Hollywood. In the last ten years, she has worked with different production teams. Currently, Sharina is worth <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">around $500,000</a>.</p><p class=align-left>In 2017, a popular entertainment outlet, Real Black Talk, shared Sharina Hudson house. According to the post, the house is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">valued at $765,000</a>. While Hunter owned the home before divorcing the talk show personality, he has not sold it. The house is in Morristown.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Perdita Weeks bio: measurements, husband, hot pics, movies and TV shows</p><p class=align-left>In May 2019, Celebrity Insider did a story on the new parents. According to the post, they bought another home in an undisclosed location. The new home now serves as a haven for the family, especially keeping them away from paparazzi. Since paparazzi have followed Sharina Hudson before, staying away from the public eye is best for her and the new child.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e07255d744a3173c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tik Tok's Avani Gregg ethnicity, nationality, parents and siblings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2019, Sharina Hudson was driving different cars. The most popular vehicle on her fleet was a Ferrari. While the Ferrari is the most popular car driven Sharina, it is reported that she has more cars. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">an article</a> by Radar Online, she has five high-end cars — including a Rolls-Royce.</p><p class=align-left>Later in 2019, different news outlets reported that Wendy Williams had repossessed the shiny Ferrari. Though Celebrity Insider reported that the car was under Wendy’s name, the other vehicles are still under Hunter’s name.</p><p class=align-left>Sharina has successfully stayed under wraps. While she and her new family are no longer on social media, they continue to be one of the most discussed families in the USA entertainment scene. The leading cause of attention is Wendy Williams, who has repeatedly made fun of her previous marriage during her shows.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Danielley Ayala bio: Age, measurements, surgery and photos</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FlW5obnFdqLWivsinmGagpZnAsLqMm6CoZZuaw6q6jKGsp6yVp3qzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMm5ibsV2dvLa%2FxGalnqxdrLyzwMdnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-napoleon-hide-his-hand.html><span>←</span><span>Napoleon Conquered a Pose and Propaganda by Hiding His Hand in His Waistcoat</span></a>
