It is a big bracket that’s able to take a lot of people, the ordinary people.</p><p class=p1>“We’re beginning to see that a lot of people just hide behind the studentship. So the student thing is not real, it’s not like they need the degrees,” he added.</p><p>Emdee’s comment riled up Nigerians on social media so much that many stormed his social media pages to rain curses on him over his comments on UK immigration by Nigerians.</p><p>Some of the reactions below;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-24-at-07.58.39-1024x455.png alt width=740 height=329 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-24-at-07.59.16-1024x223.png alt width=740 height=161 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-24-at-07.59.33-1024x264.png alt width=740 height=191 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-24-at-07.59.43-1024x264.png alt width=740 height=191 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-24-at-08.00.09.png alt width=868 height=478 sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-24-at-08.00.46.png alt width=868 height=478 sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=p1>&nbsp;Daniel Regha, said, “Emdee Tiamiyu is a mindless clown. Nigerians are already being stigmatised, our country has a negative image but instead of correcting the wrong perceptions he deliberately threw Nigerians under the bus for views and cheap clout. Ignorance is a disease. Hope karma visits him soon.”</p><p class=p1>Also in his reaction, Omolomo tweeted, “Emdee Tiamiyu finally japa and all he could do was to block the same channel he used for those coming.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e5FtZqaZnmLEqbuMnq%2Bpp6OasW7CyKyYZqWVqbWwsNJmrKydlGKvunnNop6eqpmWu7R506hknquTlr2mec%2BorZ6qpK56tbuMrqJmmaWptbC%2ByK2gnqtdlsG1rcKknJ1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-aniston-html.html><span>←</span><span>John Aniston - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
