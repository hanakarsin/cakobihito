And as excited as viewers were to see the family back together, Traci's absence was palpable on the screen. In between the fans commenting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much they missed Traci</a> and her "isms" ‚Äî like her sisters' personal favorites ‚Äî "before you write with a pen, write with a pencil" or "I can be real petty. P-E- to the T-T-Y honey!" came <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comments from fans </a>who questioned the family's motives.</p><p>Trina and Towanda shared with Distractify that Traci's presence is "definitely missing" ‚Äî not just on the show, but in their daily lives.</p><p>Still, they know The Braxtons is what she wanted. Anything besides that, to them, is "negativity," which Towanda said she wants no part of.</p><p>"I always choose not to feed into negativity because I don't want to give it life," Towanda exclusively told Distractify. "You give life to anything you feed. I'd rather pour into the positives, [which is] we are coming back, and we are here, and you can see us and join us every Friday night, and we are here for Traci."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We love and miss you Traci! üëºüèæüíó <a href=#>#TheBraxtons</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mNN9OiC8EY</a></p>‚Äî The Braxtons (@Braxtons_WeTV) <a href=#>July 27, 2024</a></figure><p>Trina agreed with Towanda and added that the public's perception of why they started the show isn't her concern.

In turn, they discuss how they remember Traci both together and separately. Trina and Towanda told us they honor her by never taking off a necklace with a hummingbird‚Äîwhich <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">each Braxton sister wears</a> to pay homage to Traci's love for hummingbirds ‚Äî unless they are with their significant others.</p><p>Towanda also said her bond with Traci's only son, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Surratt Jr.</a>, helps "keep Traci's legacy alive."</p><p>Of course, the Braxton sisters being back together to film their TV show is their collective way of telling Traci's story as she wanted.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>And while there are "somber" moments, Trina and Towanda said getting to share all of their "amazing" sisters' lighthearted and powerful moments is a "blessing" for them, whether it's filmed or not.</p><p>"I'm just, we're just so blessed that God chose us to be her sister," Towanda said. "In the spiritual world, you choose, and we were chosen to be a part of her life and she was chosen to be part of ours."</p><p>"I'm just thankful that she was placed here," she added. "And when she was, we were able to share her with the entire world, because she's such an amazing spirit.
