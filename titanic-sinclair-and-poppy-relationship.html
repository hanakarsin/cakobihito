Titanic, <a href=#>consider yourself canceled</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Today (May 6) Poppy uploaded a statement to Twitter that detailed how her ex leaked personal photos to purposely destroy her self-confidence. She also explained that she created makeup videos as an artistic way for her to combat insecurities and help others who may be grappling with the same crushing feelings about themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>She wrote, "My ex boyfriend would always tell me I looked ugly without makeup on and I should never been seen without it. Making these makeup videos not only helped me feel more comfortable in my skin, but I want to encourage other people that are being constantly put down in a similar way that it's ok to love yourself + your skin." She added, "That person is releasing photos of me without makeup (and blonde hair) plus very personal demos that only he has. This is an attempt to make me feel small, insecure and exposed."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CE5UZ3l95t</a></p>‚Äî Poppy (@poppy) <a href=#>May 6, 2020</a></figure><p>Poppy triumphantly ends her message by writing, "Those tactics aren't going to work.

Titanic and Poppy met in 2014 and started a music partnership. They began dating sometime after that (though it's not clear when exactly). The two were deeply intrenched in each other's careers and brands. At one point, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Poppy only followed Titanic on Instagram</a> so that his posts were the only ones that populated on her feed.</p><p>In fact, both Poppy and Titanic allegedly created the idea that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Titanic was Poppy's "puppet master,"</a> but Poppy later explained that it was all part of their shtick. "The narrative that we created in order to tell the story of the first album was very much Titanic is the bad guy and he's the leader, which I think is funny because it's not true. It is very much 50:50," Poppy told NME.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>However, in December 2019, Poppy painted a very different portrait of their relationship. In reality, it turns out that Titanic was manipulative and Poppy felt "trapped in a mess that I needed to dig myself out of." Before Poppy, Titanic dated Mars Argo, whom he also treated poorly, many Twitter users claim.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA">Posted by <a href=#>Poppy</a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>Saturday, December 28, 2019</a></figure><p>The leaked demo in question is this Pokemon track that Poppy posted herself on her Twitter. Although it's an awesome song, it's a huge bummer that it was originally released without her consent.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=de dir=ltr>Pok√©mon x Poppy <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YIVo56XcRj</a></p>‚Äî Poppy (@poppy) <a href=#>May 6, 2020</a></figure><p>On May 5, Poppy uploaded this video of her removing her shield-like makeup as a powerful response to Titanic's gross actions.
