Yes, fellow gaming nerds and casual Super Smash Bros. players alike, the first official trailer for 2023's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> has arrived, and the internet has plenty of opinions, as expected.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Whether your player of choice in Super Mario games was always Barbiecore Princess Peach or the titular plump <a href=#>Italian</a> plumber himself (more on his heavily discussed physique later), it's clear that Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a phenomenon since 1985</a>. Given its influential stamp on pop culture (come on, we all know the difference between the green Koopa Troopa shells and the superior red ones), it was only a matter of time before the game series inspired a blockbuster animated film.</p><p>And considering Mario himself — who first appeared in 1981's Donkey Kong — has graced more than 200 video game titles, filling his shoes is no easy gig. But the <a href=#>controversial Chris Pratt</a> gave us hope when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he relayed</a> in September 2021 that he was "working hard" on his Mario voice. Not only that, but he previously lent his voice to animated characters in 2020's Onward and 2014's The Lego Movie.</p><p>When the October 2022 voice reveal arrived, however, the hope almost unanimously fizzled.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chris Pratt's Mario voice is watered down to an upsetting degree.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“When people hear Chris Pratt’s performance, the criticism will evaporate. Maybe not entirely – people love to voice opinions, as they should," producer Chris Meledandri told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> in June 2022. Clearly, the evaporation process has not begun.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course, much of the discourse surrounding Chris Pratt's Mario voice points to the fact that ... he essentially just used his own voice. If we wanted to hear Chris Pratt's regular voice, we'd just binge-watch all of Parks and Recreation.</p><p>We demand a corny, over-exaggerated Italian accent! Is that so much to ask for? (BRB, throwing a Spiny Blue Shell Chris's way.)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"Diet Brooklyn accent"</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Though Mario's signature red cap and overalls would be ironically trendy in Brooklyn, he's no Brooklynite. Once again, The Super Mario Bros. Movie should've ensured that Mario boasted a borderline-offensive Italian accent. It's what we deserve.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Italian community is in shambles.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“I’m not sure this is the smartest defense, but as a person who has Italian-American heritage, I feel I can make that decision without worrying about offending Italians or Italian-Americans. … I think we’re going to be just fine," producer Chris Meledandri stated. Yet here we are, wishing Mario had more olive oil running through his veins.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Why hire the Jurassic World star to voice Mario when we could've gotten the likes of such Italian kings as <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a>, <a href=#>Danny DeVito</a> (who kind of resembles Mario in Matilda), or Al Pacino? Actually, we take it back; Steve Buscemi or no one.</p><p>We haven't seen Chris Pratt wave around pinched Italian fingers even once.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We were all robbed of Mario's famously juicy butt.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Not only are we missing out on a historically accurate (maybe that phrasing is a stretch), high-pitched Mario voice, but something even more traumatic plagued the Super Mario Bros. Movie trailer. Mario is missing his recognizably thick badonkadonk. Rest in peace.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">WE COULD'VE HANDLED IT!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING: After a fan outcry over Mario’s butt cheeks not being big enough in the film’s teaser poster, producer Chris Meledandri provides an explanation.</p><p>“If we made his butt appear way bigger, it would’ve looked too delicious for audiences to handle.” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ufeFTA91ZM</a></p>— Cartoon Crap (@CartoonCrap) <a href=#>October 4, 2022</a></figure><p>While this is obviously not a direct quote from the producer, we're going to pretend that it is for the sake of giggles (and to ease our suffering).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"His butt is just a linear continuation of his back."</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Okay this is a bit uncharacteristic of me but was anybody else weirded out by how flat Mario's butt is!? dude jumps around all day and has some meat on his bones, but his butt is just a linear continuation of his back. give Mario the donk <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yITYrk9063</a></p>— brandon sheffield (@necrosofty) <a href=#>October 6, 2022</a></figure><p>It's true; considering the fact that Mario spends an abundance of time jumping on mushrooms, over barrels, and into warp pipes (depending on the game, of course), his glutes should be thicker! What gives?</p><p>Alas, we will have to find a way to accept <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Dwyer</a>–voiced pancake-butt Mario.
