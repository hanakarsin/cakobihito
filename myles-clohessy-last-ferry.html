He grew up a student athlete and played Division 1 college soccer at Central Connecticut State University, before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">transferring to SUNY Purchase</a> to pursue a degree in acting. At Purchase, Myles was able to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">continue playing soccer</a>. He garnered 33 points and was named captain of the Men's Varsity Team during his senior year, per Purchase Athletics.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite his incredible athletic abilities, though, he was still determined to pursue acting over sports. After graduating from college in 2016, he was able to book a minor role on the series Blue Bloods, working alongside his dear old dad, Robert Clohessy. And not long after, Myles was cast in Season 3 of Quantico as Sean Maguire.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Both of his parents are in showbiz.</h2><p>Myles is basically <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">following in his father's footsteps</a>. The actor's father is an actor himself, having gone to Purchase College for his Bachelor's degree, before pursuing theater full-time. You may recognize his father from a variety of productions, including Blue Bloods, The Avengers, Crimson Mask, and Boardwalk Empire.</p><p>The 26-year-old's mother, Catherine Erhardt, also happens to be a former model. &nbsp;Myles' parents have been married since 1987. Needless to say, their love for the limelight certainly rubbed off on their son.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>We used to play catch, now we just run lines together 🎭 #actorfamily</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>MYLES CLOHESSY 🇺🇸🇮🇪</a> (@myleswyattclohessy) on Oct 9, 2017 at 10:33am PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Myles is a recent newlywed.</h2><p>Myles fulfilled the dream of every hopeless romantic by marrying his high school sweetheart. In Sept. 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and his now-wife, Jhessica Arango officially tied the kno</a>t. Not much is known about Jhessica as she appears to keep her private life predominantly — well — private, but it seems as though she and Myles are incredibly happy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Oh, and despite Myles' masculine exterior, he's a total softie.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Myles towers at 6-foot-2</a>, and after several years of playing soccer and boxing for fun, he has a muscular, athletic build. Needless to say, he looks a little intimidating. However, despite his manly look, the actor and former athlete has a big soft side, and he isn't afraid to show it.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Famous Birthdays, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Myles really loves dogs</a>, and has owned four Golden Retrievers over his 26 years of life. His passion for dogs actually inspired him to volunteer at various rescue centers in his free time. So if that doesn't win your heart over, we truly don't know what will.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>FAKE snow!
