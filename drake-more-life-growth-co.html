In his spare time, he even developed his own whiskey. But apparently, Drake has enough time to launch a new company and promote it in some pretty unique ways."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">promoted it once on Instagram</a> with a link to the new company's own Instagram page, which is currently set to private. But, as of Nov. 7, Drake has finally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">issued a press release</a> that discloses just what the company is and how it came to be.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>@morelife</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>champagnepapi</a> (@champagnepapi) on Nov 5, 2019 at 3:45pm PST</p></figure><p>According to the press release, Drake is teaming up with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Canopy Growth Corporation</a> to create More Life Growth Co., a fully licensed cannabis producer based in Drake’s hometown, Toronto, Canada. The release claims that the company was founded to be "centered around wellness, discovery, and overall personal growth with the hope of facilitating connections and shared experiences across the globe."</p><p>Drake began a unique promotional technique for his new company, in which his team distributed flowers to people throughout Toronto. The flowers promoted More Life without actually saying what the company was.&nbsp;The technique helped drive traffic to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">More Life Instagram</a> page which, although private, currently has 16,300 followers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So what exactly is Drake selling?</h2><p>Drake's press release didn't discuss the products that More Life will be selling, but, last month, Drake's company, Dream Crew IP, filed trademark applications for a cannabis business. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to those documents</a>, the company will be focused on selling "cannabis products and herbs, medicinal herb extracts, herbal tea, rolling papers, dried plants as well as other merch and apparel."</p><p>Drake has been getting some flack for his decision to enter the cannabis business now. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">VICE reporter Manisha Krishnan</a> noted that, according to his trademark applications, the biggest category of products that More Life will be selling doesn't have anything to do with cannabis itself, but instead, the company's merchandise and apparel.&nbsp;</p><p>More Life is expected to have pretty much every category of apparel known to humankind, including shirts, jeans, jackets, hats, gloves, leggings, lingerie, dresses, footwear, and even business wear.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY</span></figure><p>Drake is also taking some hits for being a little late to the game as he is not the first celebrity to jump into the cannabis business. Just this year, we saw several celebrities, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Rogen</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Post Malone</a>, start their own cannabis company or partner with another cannabis brand. Drake is being warned that he's entering an already over-saturated market.&nbsp;</p><p>As of now, More Life is still in development and does not yet have a launch date, so we'll all have to wait and see just how Drake is planning to bring something new to the cannabis game.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmb%2Bit8RmpKiqlWK5qrLEZp6rp6eptW6vzg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./when-is-married-at-first-sight-decision-day.html><span>←</span><span>When Is Decision Day on Married at First Sight?
