Throngs of small business workers and those who rely on the restaurant and hospitality industry have had their entire lives turned upside down. Showbusiness has been adversely affected to, not to mention organized and professional sports.</p><p>And while there's a lot to be said about tons of other economic sectors that have been rendered pretty much non-existent as a result of the pandemic, there are some positive stories to come out of this whole mess. For starters, people are finally giving healthcare workers props for the the grueling hours and important, life-saving miracles they perform on a daily basis.</p><p>In the face of all this madness, there are also some folks who are banding together in very wholesome ways. Whether it's sports stars donating money to keep stadium workers taken care of during this whole mess, or people giving hearty tips to delivery drivers and businesses that have remained and kept staff on despite taking a huge financial hit, there are, as corny as it sounds, "helpers" who have risen to the occasion.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>#NBA star Kevin Love has donated $100k to help Cleveland Cavaliers staff impacted by the season shutdown.

I'm fortunate because I live near both my mother-in-law and mom, who are awesome, and both my wife and I are working from home. So we can shift child care duty when necessary.</p><p>For those who have to rely on daycares, they have a ton of different factors to worry about: "Will my kid get COVID or spread it to a loved one? Will the workers there be OK?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hard Drive is donating a couple thousand cloth masks directly to people who need them.

Just because they didn't want to "look bad" as they promised masks to the teachers at the daycare.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Imgur</span></figure><p>The donator categorically refused and told the person that if they wanted more masks, they'd have to gather the materials and that they would charge them this time and not donate them.</p><p>The "choosing beggar" responded with, "I don't think I like the way you're talking to me," after confessing that they would have no idea where to get the materials needed to make a face mask.</p><p>People couldn't believe the nerve of the parent.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Imgur</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Imgur</span></figure><p>While others believed that the parent was "scamming" the mask maker and was attempting to sell the masks, because "fancy masks fetch a higher price."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Imgur</span></figure><p>What do you think?
