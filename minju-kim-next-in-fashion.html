Needless to add, her exquisite creations left Alexa, Tan, and the jurors completely wonderstruck. Shortly after the final dress went out, Minju was announced as the lucky winner of the $250.000 cash prize, and she also snatched up the opportunity to design a collection for Net-a-Porter.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Minju Kim won several awards in the past.</h2><p>In 2015, the designer was announced as the winner of the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers. Frequently regarded as a rite of passage for the most-sought-after fashion designers, previous nominees include Simon Porte Jacquemus, Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida, and Masayuki Ino, the brains behind the cultic Japanese streetwear brand, Doublet.&nbsp;</p><p>Minju earned the award with a playful yet feminine collection full of bold shapes and quirky designs.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>In 2013, Minju placed first in the H&M Design Award, while she was still studying at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp. She went on to create a capsule collection for H&M in the autumn of 2013, which paid homage to the mod subculture of the early 1960s.&nbsp;</p><p>The bold, strongly-defined silhouettes, over-exaggerated, fairy-tale-like accessories, and the inventive use of candy-colored knitwear made the collection stand out.&nbsp;</p><p>"Seeing how creative she is is super-inspiring. She seems like she's bubbling over with creativity," described blogger Hanneli Mustaparta in her first impressions of the collection in a promotional <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video.</a></p><p>In a previous interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buro</a>, Minju named animations as the biggest source of inspiration behind her salient creations. A long-term fan of Express 999 and the like, she frequently references fictive characters, pop culture figures, and feminist icons in her designs.&nbsp;</p><p>"Our brand has appeal because women are drawn to the whimsical and fantastical nature, and that inspires them," &nbsp;Minju told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>MINJUKIM SS20 Lookbook | La Casa Azul - Photography | @daehanx - Jewelry Collaboration | @doigte_official - #MINJUKIM #SS20</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>MINJUKIM</a> (@_minjukim_) on Oct 22, 2019 at 9:45pm PDT</p></figure><p>"I wish people feel happy and comfortable, when they wear my collection. My team and I try our best to make the pieces playful, but still beautiful and of high quality," she added.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, Minju landed the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a few looks for BTS. The capsule collection marked her foray into the world of menswear design, blending together her trademark, gumdrop-colored aesthetic with the unmistakable style of the most prominent K-pop band out there.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforavttRmoqKlXaOyucCMoqVmnpGotaq7zQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-2023-tinubu-visits-ibb-for-consultation.html><span>←</span><span>Tinubu Visits IBB For Consultation (Photos)</span></a>
