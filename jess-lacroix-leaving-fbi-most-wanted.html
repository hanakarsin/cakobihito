However, executive producer David Hudgins shared a juicy teaser for LaCroix's final episode and what could prompt his exit. Speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, he said that "the episode is a combination of two things. It’s a very intense episode about domestic violence, and it also ties in thematically with Jess’s experience with Sarah’s stalker, Hugh."</p><p>He went on to say, "We felt like that was an interesting additional layer to the episode. And then on top of that, we’ve got Jess and Sarah in a very good place, talking about going on the first vacation that Sarah has ever seen Jess take.”</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinemablend</a>, David also said that they "wanted to give him a big episode for his exit. And that's how we ended up with the storyline."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Hopefully, fans will see Jess and Sarah sail off happily into the sunset and not involved in something tragic.
