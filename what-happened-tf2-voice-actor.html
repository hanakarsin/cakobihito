He was later moved to Seattle's Swedish Medical Center when he worsened, but unfortunately ended up dying there before he could fully recover from his comorbidities.</p><p>When May passed away, the Rekindle School, where he had been teaching classes, shared a list of just some of his impressive achievements throughout his acting career. In addition to playing Team Fortress 2's Soldier and Star Fox 64's Peppy Hare and Andross, he had roles in games like Sly 3 and Age of Empires 2. He was a well-known voice in the gaming community because of these contributions, but his list of theater roles was especially impressive.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Rekindle School</span></figure><p>May appeared in "over 300 shows," according to the Rekindle school, including Tevye in Fiddler On the Roof, Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman, Ben Franklin in 1776, Teddy in Arsenic and Old Lace, Pseudolus in A Funny Thing Happened On the Way To the Forum, W. O. Gant in Look Homeward, Angel, Oscar in The Odd Couple, Weller in The Gin Game, Sid in Take Me Along, and Drummond in Inherit the Wind.
