The Chameleon on Season 5 of </strong><strong>The Masked Singer</strong><strong>, who came in third in the competition, was rapper </strong><a href=#><strong>Wiz Khalifa</strong></a><strong>. Read on for the clues and initial guesses!</strong></p><p>Throughout the time it has been on the air, <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a> has always thrown fans for a crazy loop trying to distinguish which stars are behind the outlandish costumes.</p><p>For Season 5, the competition has been ramped up a notch, though it's kept its same set of judges. Some familiar faces have even returned to the cast from their original positions on The Masked Singer UK.&nbsp;</p><p>One of these familiar faces is a reptile dressed in a sparkly suit who's making judges think their hardest: Chameleon. So, who is Chameleon on The Masked Singer? Here's what we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Chameleon on 'The Masked Singer'? Here are the clues we have so far.</h2><p>As Season 5 continues to unravel, fans are looking for any hint as to who Chameleon might be. Unfortunately, for now, the actual identity of the reptilian creature is still a mystery.&nbsp;</p><p>Chameleon, who dons a star-studded suit, a bold outlandish belt, and a red mohawk-style hairdo, has been a fan favorite. However, nobody has been able to put all the pieces together yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the character's identity is still a mystery, there's some key info that has been revealed.</p><p>One big tidbit is that Chameleon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">boasted</a> that "changing colors is kind of my thing." Beyond that, in the character's promo, Chameleon can be seen sitting next to three vintage televisions and a red book. Also, Chameleon's first clues included a motorcycle with "2" and "3" on its handlebars, a license plate that read "CAMOFLAG," and a monitor that read "007."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: The Masked Singer/YouTube</span></figure><p>The character then credits their "Pops" for keeping them timely and encouraging them to be a tinkerer. Finally, they're seen reading a book with "I.T." written on the cover.</p><p>In week two, we got a <a href=#>Cluedle-Doo clue</a> for Chameleon: Chameleon has a history with precious gemstones.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: The Masked Singer/YouTube</span></figure><p>Clues from Episode 4 include cheese, a graduation cap, a taxi with peaches painted on the doors, the word "Bonjour," a tailor's measuring tape on a dress form, and a rainbow paintbrush.</p><p>Chameleon also appeared on Episode 5 with another clue package that included a "slippery when wet" road sign, five analog clocks set to 3:46, and a rocket. We also learned that Chameleon apparently loves cooking when a plate of Buffalo wings with ranch appeared — they said, "If anybody knows me, they know I’m always cooking something in the kitchen."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: The Masked Singer/YouTube</span></figure><p>In the Episode 7 clue package for Chameleon, the singer spoke about meeting his idol (the GOAT) by winning a local radio contest. The GOAT was portrayed as someone wearing a lime green outfit (feather boa included!) and holding a fly swatter. There was also someone dressed as a fly and holding a briefcase emblazoned with a giant #2, and being chased by another person who was dragging some kind of rodent stuffed animal behind them.&nbsp;</p><p>Additional clues include a match, a bell necklace, a disco ball, and a picture of two gazelles locking horns. Watch the clue package here.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: The Masked Singer/YouTube</span></figure><p>In Episode 10, we got the following clues: orange slices, a plate of brownies with a small sign reading "brownies for $ale," an airplane, and a captain's hat.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: The Masked Singer/YouTube</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In Episode 12, Chameleon said</a>: "It feels good being Chameleon because I love this character as much as I love myself. What's special about me is my confidence and my ability to adapt and adjust. Moving around as a kid was very challenging because, you know, you're the new kid. So you got to really sink in it and learn how to, you know, move and groove. But I was always good at it."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: The Masked Singer/YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are some guesses as to who Chameleon could be? Many think it's a rapper.</h2><p>Details still remain vague around the true identity of Chameleon, but that hasn't stopped show judges and fans alike from making assumptions based on the clues they've received so far.</p><p>Most people think Chameleon is likely a rapper, but the judges guessed people with a few other professions as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Ken Jeong led off the guessing by stating that he thought Chameleon is NBA legend Dwight Howard. Subsequently, Robin Thicke chimed in with his assumption that Chameleon is actually LMFAO member Redfoo. Other guesses include Steve Aoki, Calvin Harris, and Diplo.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by WK (@wizkhalifa)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>But the guess that has been getting the most traction is that Chameleon is rapper Wiz Khalifa. At 6 feet, 4 inches tall, the star perfectly fits the build, and the character's command over cadence and trickier verses during the competition is a clear indicator that its secret contestant has a background in rap.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the rumors of Wiz being Chameleon are furthered by the links between the "007" in the promo and Wiz's hit song "James Bong," as well as the "2" and "3" on the motorcycle linking to his other hit track "23." Beyond even that, the promo featured a "Beware of Pit" reference, which many are linking to the rapper's hometown of Pittsburgh.</p><p>If none of those points are convincing enough for how much the rumor makes sense, the "CAMOFLAG" license plate on Chameleon's motorcycle is likely a reference to Wiz's ex-military father, who he has spoken about extensively throughout his career.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>When Chameleon mentioned that they had lost someone close to them, many took that to be a reference to Wiz Khalifa's sister, who died in 2017 at the age of 32. Wiz's sister was transgender, which may be what Chameleon is referencing when they say that someone close to them "was constantly attacked for who she was."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Season 5 'Masked Singer' cast has been eclectic, to say the least.</h2><p>Following the <a href=#>shocking reveals we've had so far this</a> season of The Masked Singer, fans are quite literally expecting anything when it comes to who could be behind the rest of the costumes. With a slow trickle of hints accompanied by some truly stellar performances, only time will tell who emerges from behind the masks of the next characters in question.</p><p>The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on FOX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJygkaKyrbHOp2SmmaOgsqV50qKloJ2i</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./4261-skeleton-masked-singer.html><span>←</span><span>The 4261 'The Masked Singer' Skeleton Clue Leads Down Several Paths</span></a>
