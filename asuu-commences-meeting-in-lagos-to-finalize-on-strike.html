The major issue with ASUU now is the deployment of UTAS which is under the purview of NITDA which is under the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy. The NUC also has its role to play.</p><p>“My role is to play a reconciliatory officer. If their employers and the NUC fail to reconcile them, then I step in as the reconciliatory officer. It’s not more than that. But I know their employers are finding ways to resolve these issues.”</p><p>This is coming after the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) of Nigeria prayed President Muhammadu Buhari-led government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to resolve their lingering issues to avoid another academic shutdown in the country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BrZpqrpap6pLvMppynm5Woeq6xxK2gp59dnrtuuMCgpqxlpKR6p7XNmqOispVivK950q2poqOVZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-percy-ncis-new-orleans.html><span>←</span><span>Sonja Percy Is Gone but Not Forgotten on 'NCIS: New Orleans'</span></a>
