In fact, dual-income families <a href=#>of two folks with master's degrees are still struggling to buy a home without having to uproot their lives and move to a completely different area</a>.</p><p>It's hard to argue that nearly every issue comes second to food and shelter. Sure, there are probably lobbyist groups and media corporations that'll cover other issues, or try to get folks rooting for one political party or the other that may want to distract from this readily apparent problem.</p><p>There might even be politicians whose entire platforms run on hate of a particular individual or a specific party, but there's one thing that affects everybody regardless of their political allegiance and it's that they want a home that they can own and not worry about losing should they ever face economic hardship, and that they can put food on the table in said home.</p><p>But whoever is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">running America right now</a> isn't doing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very good job of ensuring that this issue is being resolved</a>. It seems as if they are ensuring the very opposite happens, especially on the home-buying front, because there's been a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">huge increase in the number of homes being bought by corporations</a>.</p><p>It's something that throngs of folks are talking about, like TikToker <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@travelingnurse</a> who posted about this phenomenon in a viral clip discussing corporate real estate monopolies currently forming in America.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@travelingnurse href=#>@travelingnurse</a><p>Say goodbye to whatever crumb of a middle class is left @TiffanyCianci <a title=middleclass href=#>#middleclass</a> <a title=homeownership href=#>#homeownership</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - lex RN BSN" href=#>♬ original sound - lex RN BSN</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @travelingnurse</span></figure><p>She titled her clip "The Death of Home Ownership in America" and while it may seem hyperbolic, there are some hard stats that highlight what many may want to write off as a fear-mongering response.</p><p>The woman references another TikTok video where she mentions how "private equity firms" are buying up all of the single-family houses in the country to gain a monopoly on home ownership so properties can then be sold at artificially jacked-up rates, locking families into long-term mortgages that give the private equity firms compound returns on their investments.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>America Is Being Transformed Into The Land Of <a href=#>#Renters</a>.

Are people going to start living out of their cars? That's kind of difficult to do if you've got a family. Are you going to be forced to share rent with multiple people in a single unit? Private equity firms would probably love that — packing more folks into smaller plots of square footage to maximize profits doesn't seem like something that would upset investors on an earnings call.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Corporations are causing the housing crisis.

For housing specifically: implementing exponential taxation fees that go directly to the township for housing stipends, or as cash refunds for renters of properties for corporate entities that own multiple residences/apartments.</p><p>The goal of the aforementioned legal tax stipulation, just as private citizens are taxed for owning multiple properties, is to make it financially untenable for real estate companies to hoard properties.</p><p>Another way the Federal government could help resolve this issue is to force any business or landlord that has rental units to give equity to its residents.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s not inflation, it’s GREEDFLATION.
