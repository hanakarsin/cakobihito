We'll meet six new couples from all over the country as they try to make their relationships work with their partner who is behind bars.

This season is going to be fire.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Tennie and Rob</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Husband and wife Tennie and Rob are from Yukon, Okla. Life isn't easy for mom-of-two Tennie, whose husband Rob has been in prison for 16 years. But weirdly enough, Rob is able to help around the house because he has access to a phone, which allows him to watch his family through cameras set up in the house. Tennie has accepted the cameras, but the tension builds when Rob becomes increasingly controlling and overbearing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ayonna and Jamahl</h2><p>Ayonna, a mom and exotic dancer from Lancaster, Penn., is dating a man named Jamahl, who previously was her best friend's partner. Naturally, it's a messy situation that was made even messier when Jamahl went to prison. Nonetheless, Ayonna has stuck by his side. However, a secret Jamahl's family revealed to Ayonna threatened to shatter everything. Will their bond survive this hidden truth?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Andrew and Candice</h2><p>Andrew, a total sucker for love from Greenwich, Nj, found his soulmate in the last place you'd think to look: a prison pen pal website. But Candice's letters had him hooked instantly. Not only does he start paying for an apartment for them to live in after she gets out of prison, but he buys her a truck and plans to ask her to marry him, too. Is she into him as much as he's into her? We'll just have to wait and find out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Rick and Samantha</h2><p>Hailing from Gilbert, Ariz, Rick, who previously has been married twice, ended up reconnecting with his high school girlfriend, Samantha, years later and turns out that the chemistry is still there. The only issue is that she's currently incarcerated. Fortunately, Rick isn't wasting any time. He proposed to Samantha during a prison visit, but will they actually tie the knot?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Joey and Michael</h2><p>Joey, who is from Boise, Idaho, has a good job and a hot boyfriend. The only problem is he still lives at home with his parents, and his boyfriend, Michael, is incarcerated for drug-related charges. Will this relationship last and is there a future between them? We'll just have to tune in to find out.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Shonta and True</h2><p>Shonta, from Kansas City, Miss, is enamored with her fiancé True, who is currently behind bars. She's so head-over-heels for this man that she moved her family to another state to be with him and said yes when he proposed to her. But here's the truth: She's been with True for over two years and has never visited him in prison despite uprooting her life to be with him. In total, Shonta has spent over $30,000 on True and has taken on two mortgages to make their relationship work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoby3sYydrKuhnpx6rbvCpKypZaOarrS7zWZsZmpgZ4E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./esm-ingham-html.html><span>←</span><span>Esm Ingham - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
