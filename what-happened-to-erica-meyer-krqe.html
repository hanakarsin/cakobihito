Here's what we know about what she's said, and why she seems to have made the decision to leave.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@erica__meyer</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Erica Meyer from KRQE?</h2><p>In her final broadcast, Erica thanked her colleagues and the viewers at home for giving her a chance to come into their homes every day. She posted that farewell <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a>, where she wrote:</p><p>"Last day of work farewell! I’ll be moving from Albuquerque, doing some traveling, and spending time with my family and friends over the next two months. TBD where to next! Can’t wait to find out and let you all know! Be sure to stay tuned here."</p><p>Erica had been with KRQE for five years, and she described her departure from the network as "bittersweet." She also described how New Mexico became a home to her during that time, even though she originally went there just looking for a job. It seems like Erica is ready for her next adventure, though, and that's why she made the decision to leave. There's been no indication that she was fired, and based on her discussion of moving, it seems like she has been planning this for some time.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fans paid tribute to Erica during her last broadcast.</h2><p>Although loyal Albuquerque viewers were sad to see Erica go, many of them also wished her well and said they were eager to see where she might land next.</p><p>"It's not goodbye, it’s see you later," one of her colleagues wrote. "It’s been the best working with you, Erica! From the laughs, to the whistling in the weather center, to George Strait commercial breaks! Really going to miss you and wish you nothing but the best!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Erica Meyer (@erica__meyer)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@erica__meyer</span></figure><p>"You’re going to be severely missed! Life’s adventures are just beginning though! Live loud and never look back," a viewer added.</p><p>Clearly, then, Erica was beloved by both colleagues and viewers at home, and made the choice to leave for reasons that may have had nothing to do with her work. She's treating life like an adventure, and it seems that she's eager to begin its next chapter.</p><p>While we may not know exactly where Erica will wind up next, her fans seem confident that she will land someone amazing and continue to deliver the weather in the way that her fans have come to love. Until then, she can take solace in the knowledge that she will be missed, and that she's now got the chance to enjoy time off without worrying about the obligations of her career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSeqpmYrm65xLKcq2Wbp76m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shaibu-desperate-to-become-edo-governor-may-consider-coup-against-me-obaseki-cries-out.html><span>←</span><span>Shaibu Desperate To Become Edo Governor, May Consider Coup Against Me</span></a>
