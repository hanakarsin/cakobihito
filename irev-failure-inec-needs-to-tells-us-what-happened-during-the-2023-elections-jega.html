And of course, they can also use ways and means to not only truncate but also bypass something that has actually been put legitimately in order to add to the integrity of the process.</p><p>“If you ask my opinion, I feel very strongly that INEC needs to tell us more about what happened with the IreV. In fact, at one point, I was even calling for a thorough public inquiry about what happened with regards to IreV. I feel that something has happened, that in spite of the confidence and the very articulate manner the INEC chairman (Mahmood Yakubu) had spoken about the IreV and it then failed.</p><p>“I believe that some of our reckless politicians may have infiltrated it and truncated it but INEC will take the blame for that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FvZqKqlat6p63IpayrnV2eu6avjKecnpyjYsGwedOeo6WrXarAbsPHmqtmoJGlvaa6xJ1kna2inruoedOhnGZqYGeAbrHLnpqtoZ%2BjwG62xKCYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-dakuku-peterside-charges-amaechi-to-declare-for-presidency.html><span>←</span><span>Dakuku Peterside Charges Amaechi To Declare For Presidency</span></a>
