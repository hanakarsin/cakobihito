Honor Society, the new film from Paramount Plus, is no exception to this rule. Honor Society follows a student named Honor (Angourie Rice) who is determined to get into Harvard if only she can score a recommendation from her guidance counselor (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and take down her student competition."><meta name=author content="Enda Jantzen"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In January 2022, <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> said that Awesomeness Films had greenlit Honor Society, starring Angourie Rice, <a href=# style=text-align:start>Gaten Matarazzo</a>, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Stranger Things alum Gaten plays Michael, one of Honor's student competitors and eventually her love interest.</p><p>Filming had already begun in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada when the movie was announced, so the shooting process seemed shorter. Vancouver is widely known as "Hollywood North" for the vast array of film and television projects that film there, including shows on the CW such as Riverdale and films such as A Series of Unfortunate Events and X-Men Origins: Wolverine.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Angourie Rice (@angourierice)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram/@angourierice</span></figure><p>Specific filming locations, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cinemaholic</a>, include the New Westminster Secondary School, which stands in for George H. W. Bush High School depicted in the film. Other locations utilized by production include Canada Way and 10th Avenue in Burnaby. Filming was extremely quick, and actress Angourie Rice posted wrap photos in March 2022, just two months after the film was announced.</p><p>If you are interested in catching all the gorgeous locations around Vancouver in action, head over to Paramount Plus now where Honor Society is currently streaming.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmrpqrXZ28r7vRZqqom5mawbp5xaKjpp2U</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./427607-willis-raburu-shares-intimate-moments-young-son-rocking-sleep-html.html><span>←</span><span>Willis Raburu Shares Intimate Moments with Young Son While Rocking Him to Sleep</span></a>
