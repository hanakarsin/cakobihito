Now that the show is officially in its fifth season, fans are curious about Missy's return date and whether Maggie will come back to the New York field office.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is Maggie Bell coming back to 'FBI?' It's happening sooner than you think!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bennett Raglin/CBS</span></figure><p>FBI viewers can breathe a sigh of relief, as their favorite agent is set to return to the small screen on <strong>Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2022</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>According to CBS, the episode will be titled "Ready or Not." Here's the synopsis for the episode: "Maggie returns from medical leave in time to help the team investigate the homicides of a law student on track to attend Quantico and a young man with possible gang ties. Also, an inadvertent revelation from Maggie to OA causes him to worry that his partner is rushing back into the job too quickly."</p><p>Back in September, Executive producer Rick Eid spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a> and revealed that Maggie will be dealing with the emotional and psychological trauma of the accident upon her return to the office. "Maggie is resilient and strong. OA knows that, but he’s also very protective — maybe even too protective,” Rick shared. “But, at the end of the day, they’re great friends and will always be a rock for each other."</p><p>Missy also shared the exciting news of her return to the show this past summer on Instagram, along with a photo of her two adorable kids with <a href=#>her husband, Tom Oakley</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Missy Peregrym (@mperegrym)</a></p></figure><p>“FBI is starting up again in a couple of weeks, but I will be returning to work in September,” Missy captioned the post. "I’m relieved and grateful that I am afforded the space to bond with my family, to rest and heal and be a mother (which is harder than work!). I understand this is a luxury, and I wish every mother/parent/caretaker had this too. Thank you for all the love, prayers and support from this community."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's going to happen to Missy's replacement, Shantel VanSanten?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>During Missy's break from filming, <a href=#>Shantel VanSanten</a> was cast as Nina Chase, OA’s temporary partner. However, fans of Nina don't have to worry — she's not going anywhere.</p><p>According to Rick, Nina will just be moving departments and will still make appearances on the popular show.</p><p>"We may see Nina moving onto a new office or a different unit," he added. "But she was a great asset during Maggie’s absence, and I think we can expect her to stay connected to the team in an interesting way."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Fans are definitely rooting for Shantel to become a series regular alongside Missy.</p><p>"I’ve missed Maggie. But I’ve come to really like Nina and really hope they don’t kill her off or she leaves. I’d like to see more of her," one viewer tweeted before another added, "If they're using old footage — they don't have as much Nina. Plus, if they plan on bringing Maggie back — they want to promote her more. I don't think that says anything about their plans for Nina. They would be dumb to kill her off, but I wouldn't be surprised."</p><p>We have a feeling there will be room for both!</p><p>Watch FBI Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on CBS. You can also stream the show on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuucCgnqKdXZi8rrXNoGSbmZOgeqeuyA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./topic.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About INEC On Naija News</span></a>
