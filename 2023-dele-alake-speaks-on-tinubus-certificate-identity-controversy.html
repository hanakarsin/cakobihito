People say we heard, we heard, rumour-mongering nobody has ever shown a document like to say this is the certificate with Amoda or whatever.</p><p>“I always say that Nigerians should subject this thing to critical analysis. I am not saying that people should not carry rumours because, in political environments or political games like this, opponents must dig anything; any dirt, to throw at you. But the point is he who alleges must prove. You must show documentary evidence, I have seen none.</p><p>“The issue of primary school you have just mentioned. Let me clear the air today. If you are not old enough, there are people around you who are old enough to know that in those days, when people were indigent and schools were not as many as we have today; a lot of people were indigent and couldn’t afford the school to fees to go to formal institutions and at that time a lot of people did read at home and passed their exams.</p><p>“Today I can name you professors who never went to secondary schools who passed their exams from home. Let me even shock you further. The Queen of England of the whole world, she never went to any formal school, not elementary, not any. Go and research it; that is the Queen of England.“</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BrZmtoYmh6pbHLnmSapJGgsm6%2Fz56YpKtdpLtuwMinrJuto2Kwpr7Top2im5Gpsm61w56lraGkrnqku82tqaiulafAuns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-you-use-oculus-quest-2-with-nintendo-switch.html><span>←</span><span>Can You Use the Oculus Quest 2 With the Nintendo Switch?</span></a>
