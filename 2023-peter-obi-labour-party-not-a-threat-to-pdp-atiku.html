He added that the party does not have Governors, members of the National Assembly and State Assemblies.</p><p><strong><a href=#>The former vice president</a></strong> asserted that the party will not divide the votes meant for the PDP in some&nbsp;regions as suggested by some political analysts.</p><p>The PDP presidential candidate, however, mocked the LP over its performance in the just concluded Osun governorship election.</p><p>He said: “I really don’t expect the Labour Party to take as many votes from the PDP as people are suggesting.</p><p>“We could have seen it in the last election in Osun state. What is the performance of the Labour Party?</p><p>“This is a party that doesn’t have a governor, doesn’t have members of the national assembly, doesn’t have state assembly members, and politics in this country depends on the structures you have at the various levels — at the local government level, at the state level, and at the national level.”</p><p>Atiku said 90 percent of people in the North are not on social media, insinuating that it will limit the chances of the LP winning the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>“So, it is very difficult to expect a miracle to happen, simply because Peter Obi is in the Labour Party. After all, they were saying through social media, that they had more than one million votes in Osun state.</p><p>“But how many votes did Labour Party get in Osun? And then again, mark you, you’re talking about social media. In the north, 90 percent of our people are not tuned to social media,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FrZmtoYmh6sbHTnqlmp5Keeq2twaisq2Wglr%2B1xYynpq1lkWLBqb7EmqtmrJ9ivaW8jJqroqOlZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-does-chelsea-have-a-3-on-their-jerseys.html><span>←</span><span>Why Is Chelsea Suddenly Rocking a Number 3 on Their Jerseys?</span></a>
