Our priority as GOVERNMENT based on the provision of our constitution 1999 (as amended) Section 14(2)b is SECURITY, not just economy. For sure, no going back at all. Let’s the sponsors continue”.</p><p>“If you are yet to verify your SIM using NIN, do it very soon, b4 our next action. Criminals are feeling the heat,” he said.</p><p>It will be recalled that the Federal Government on Friday (2nd April) disclosed that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>the NIN-SIM linkage</a></strong> has been extended to May 6, 2021.</p><p>The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, <strong>Isa Pantami</strong> in a statement noted that the request for the extension was presented to <strong>President Muhammadu Buhari</strong> and he endorsed it.</p><p>Pantami who chaired the meeting of the Ministerial Task Force on the NIN-SIM data linkage on Thursday in Abuja according to the statement jointly signed by Dr Ikechukwu Adinde of NCC and Kayode Adegoke of NIMC said the current number of monthly enrolment has increased significantly to about 2.6 million registrations.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) <strong>Salihu Moh.
