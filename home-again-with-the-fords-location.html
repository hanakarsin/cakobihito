Loren Ruch, the senior vice president of programming and development for HGTV, talked with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TRIB Live</a> about the new show and how HGTV decided to change the name of the series and focus on the trend of people moving back to their hometowns.&nbsp;</p><p>Loren shared, “This series specifically features people who are moving back into their (Pittsburgh) childhood homes or neighborhoods. Leanne and Steve help them bring back some of the nostalgia they remember while also bringing their homes to the present day.”&nbsp;</p><p>Home Again With the Fords includes home renovations in Carnegie, Dorseyville, Fox Chapel, Franklin Park, and Squirrel Hill. Interestingly, the decision to change the show's concept was made before Leanne's own life reflected the new model.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HGTV</span></figure><p>Leanne knows exactly what the homeowners are going through in the new show. She recently moved back to the area from Los Angeles with Erick, her husband, and their baby girl, Ever. In a phone interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pittsburgh Post Gazette</a>, Leanne said, “We have been able to highlight different neighborhoods and talk more about our amazing hometown of Pittsburgh. I’m excited for viewers to get to know us, our family, and our hometown more in this new format.” &nbsp;</p><p>She also added, "The new season is special to us for so many reasons. We now have hour-long episodes, which lets us dive more into the clients' stories, which directly impact design decisions.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Fords (@thefords)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did the families get in touch with Leanne and Steve to be on the show?</h2><p>Families who wanted to have their houses chosen for the Fords to renovate went through a few different avenues, including the casting departments of HGTV’s production company, High Noon Entertainment, and word of mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>During the premiere episode of Home Again With the Fords that featured the Kerr family, Leanne revealed that the family had reached out to her and Steve about their Aspinwall Victorian via Instagram last year. &nbsp;</p><p>When Pittsburgh was chosen as their shooting location, Leanne got in touch with the family.
