The much younger Nigerian man met the Trump-loving Meemaw from Georgia via Facebook, and their relationship blossomed from there. The couple first appeared on 90 Day Fiancé during Season 2, and it took several years before Michael was able to actually make it to the United States. Both hoped that the relationship would go the distance, but instead, it went to hell.</p><p>There is a common issue that has been seen over the years both on the show and in reality: younger men from other countries who seek out the company of older and gullible American women who are looking for love. The idea behind it is getting a green card to seek out a better life before dumping the person they used to get there. Now that Michael is free from Angela, does he have a new girlfriend?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @shhmeggan</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Social media detectives have a hunch about who Michael Ilesanmi's alleged new girlfriend is, and she doesn't live in New Jersey.</h2><p>Ever so vigilant, social media detectives have discovered that Michael might have a new girlfriend. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reposted a TikTok</a> from an account handle under the name of "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shhmeggan</a>." The post shows a very peaceful Michael dancing with the caption, "Only Michael and I know what <a href=#>we have endured.</a> Allow us to enjoy ourselves."</p><p>While this is not necessarily a romantic message, it does give off that kind of vibe. Michael, however, has firmly denied that he is dating anyone at this time as he is taking his time mourning his marriage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Despite Angela Deem's rants and raves, it appears that Michael truly did want to be with her.</h2><p>Initially, it seemed obvious that Michael was using Angela to come to America. However, over time, viewers noticed his willingness to put up with how she treated him. When Angela wasn't accusing Michael of cheating, she focused on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fetishizing him</a>.</p><p>She constantly talked about <a href=#>their sex life</a> and the size of his genitalia but never really mentioned anything about his personality. Those who still thought he was a scammer had a change of thought after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he attempted</a> to get her to repatriate to Nigeria.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Regardless of Michael's initial intentions in pursuing Angela, he is still a victim of domestic abuse.</h2><p>During 90 Day Fiancé, Angela was consistently seen shouting at Michael, pushing him, and even spitting on him. Angela — who fans initially thought had been — is stuck on the idea that he is using her, which is likely why she feels like she's the victim, even though Michael is a legitimate victim of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">domestic abuse</a>.</p><p>When Michael ran away from their home in Georgia, he says went to the police seeking safety after she allegedly tried to taser him in the face. Michael is a survivor, and even those who think he scammed Angela are happy for him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4xyZ2acka56p7XAp5qeZZ2esKmtxKVkoZmmmnqiecaiqaWeop6yr7A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-presidency-17-anambra-monarchs-dump-peter-obi-to-back-atiku.html><span>←</span><span>17 Anambra Monarchs Dump Peter Obi To Back Atiku</span></a>
