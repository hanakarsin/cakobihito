They were pooled in group B alongside Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona, and Inter Milan of Italy. Spurs commenced their title race with an away match at the San Siro where they lost 2-1 after conceding two late goals. Their next match was against Barcelona at Webley, and again they lost 4-2 in favour of the Catalans. Their third match ended 2-2 against PSV.</p><p class=align-left>In the return leg matches, they won twice against PSV and Inter Millan in a 2-1, and 1-0 respectively. They closed their pool matches with a 1-1 draw against Barcelona and were tied on points with Inter Milan. However, they qualified for the next round as runners up due to the head-to-head away goals advantage.</p><p class=align-left>In the round of 16, Spurs faced German side club, Borussia Dortmund in a match that ended 3-0 at Spurs where the home team won. The second leg encounter was played at Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, where the score ended at 1-0 favouring the visitors. Cumulatively, Spurs emerged the overall winners with an aggregate of four goals, sending them to the quarterfinals of the competition.</p><p class=align-left>In the quarterfinals, Spurs were drawn against bitter rivals and English side Champions Manchester City. Tottenham were the hosts of the first leg which ended 1-0 in favour of Spurs, a good opener for their new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The second leg was played in Etihad, in what was described as the match of the season. The game ended 4-3 in favour of the hosts, but Tottenham advanced to the semifinals on account of away goals.</p><p class=align-left>In the semi-finals, Spurs were drawn against the resurgent Dutch side, Ajax, the four-time winners of the European Cup. With Harry Kane missing in the squad, Spurs lost their home-based fixture 1-0 and dimmed their chances of proceeding to the finals. However, the hat trick by Moura during the second leg was a turning point for the Spurs as the match ended 2-3 in favour of Spurs. Tottenham escaped with the win narrowly on account of away goals advantage, leaving the Dutch champions heartbroken as they were the favourites coming into the match.</p><h2>How Liverpool reached the finals</h2><p class=align-left>After emerging as the runners up in last season’s campaign, Liverpool automatically qualified for the Champions League slot. They were pooled against Paris Saint Germaine, Napoli, and Red Star Belgrade. After playing six matches, they emerged with 9 points and tied with Napoli. However, they advanced to the round of 16, thanks to the many goals they had scored.</p><p class=align-left>At 16, the Reds matched against Bayern Munich, where they emerged with a 0-0 draw in the first leg and a 3-1 win in the second leg in favour of Liverpool. The Reds were back to their winning ways when they were matched against the Portuguese champions, Porto. Liverpool won 6-1 on aggregate where the first leg ended in a 2-0 brace and the second leg saw a 4-1 stunner in the Reds’ favour.</p><p class=align-left>The semi-final was the epitome of their campaign as the Reds were matched against already crowned La Liga champions, Barcelona. In what seemed like an obvious outcome match, Barcelona took advantage of Liverpool’s defence weaknesses and capitalized on it with a 3-0 victory. This match was occasioned by mixed reactions after Messi scored his 600th goal for the Catalans through a 25-yard free kick in the 82nd minute.</p><p class=align-left>The second leg was an almost obvious walk over for Barcelona as Liverpool had a 3-0 deficit to equalize and score a new goal if they were to qualify. Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp was quoted imploring his players to "just try" or "fail in the most beautiful way." Liverpool managed to outperform the Catalans and overturn the deficit emerging with a 4-0 win at Anfield. The final aggregate was a 4-3 score, and Liverpool was once again on the road to the finals.</p><h2>Liverpool Vs Tottenham highlights of the season</h2><p class=align-left>In the just concluded 2018/2019 EPL campaign, the two teams were phenomenal in their performances. Liverpool emerged the first runners up after Manchester city with a whopping 97 points, just one point behind the Champions. Further, they have lost only one match in the entire 38 fixtures, winning 30, drawing seven times and scoring 89 goals.</p><p class=align-left>Tottenham put a spirited fright throughout the entire season to emerge fourth with 71 points, just one behind third-place Chelsea. They won 21 matches, lost 13, and emerged with two draws. With a goal difference of 28, Spurs are already qualified for the Champions League next season, on condition that Chelsea wins the Europa League finals.</p><p class=align-left>The teams are on the brink of making history, and each manager wants to add achievement in management portfolios. The two teams will be bringing nothing but the exemplary performance and quality football.</p><h2>Liverpool Vs Tottenham latest news</h2><p class=align-left>Naby Keita will not be playing for the Reds in the Saturday night clash.

We wanted it really desperately.<p class=align-left>For Spurs, there are still fitness concerns over the inclusion of Harry Kane, as the star is yet to return after more than five games out following an injury. Winks will not play for the Spurs due to an injury he acquired in the course of the Premier League season.

All teams are fully composed and on top of their form. The managers have expressed their feelings on preparations ahead of the match. However, there are still worries about the return of Harry Kane, but that does not seem to stop the Spurs’ ambitions. They have already won the semifinals against resilient Ajax without him and would do it again.</p><p class=align-left>Liverpool, on the other hand, has been here already and are better experienced at this level of the competition. Despite displaying a great play in the 2017/2018 finals against Real Madrid, they still lost owing to the poor performance of their then goalkeeper, Loris Karius. This time, they are back on the pitch with both confidence and experience they gained from the last UCL finals encounter.</p><p class=align-left>After 172 encounters between these two sides, Liverpool has emerged winners 82 times against Tottenham’s 48 times, and 42 draws. In their meetings last season, Tottenham lost both home and away 1-2, and 2-1 respectively.</p><p class=align-left>Based on the performance of the teams and history, we predict that there are better chances in favour of the Reds. Given their excellent striking lineup, their strong defence led by Van Dijk, their exceptional midfield lineup, tactical play throughout the competition, and the team history, Liverpool will emerge winners.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Match prediction:</strong> Liverpool wins</p><p class=align-left><strong>Score prediction: </strong>2 – 1</p><p class=align-left>You are now familiar with each side, their history, head-to-head encounters, club performance last season, and the managers’ beliefs and resolves.
