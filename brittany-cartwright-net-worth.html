Brittany first joined the Vanderpump Rules squad in Season 4 as Jax‚Äôs girlfriend, but since then they got married and started a family.</p><p>Now with a young son, <a href=#>Cruz Michael Cauchi</a>, the state of Brittany and Jax‚Äôs relationship is more significant than ever. Their first reality television appearance in years on the new show, <a href=#>The Valley</a>, is set for March 19, 2024, on <a href=#>Bravo</a>. Could adding reality television back into their lives be the disruption that caused their separation? Regardless, we want to know if Brittany will be OK if they get divorced. So, what‚Äôs her net worth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Brittany Cartwright has an estimated net worth of $1 million.</h2><p>Brittany may not be the richest reality star, but she has some assets to her name. When Brittany announced her separation from Jax, she shared that she moved into a separate house. She at least has enough money to move into a new house at a moment‚Äôs notice.</p><p>With over 1.7 million followers on Instagram, Brittany can easily make money through social media partnerships, as she seems to do with Jenny Craig. She and Jax also bring in money through their shared podcast, When Reality Hits with Jax and Brittany, which uses sponsorships to bring in income for the couple.</p><p class="sc-bA-DUxO bSiVrH"><span>Brittany Cartwright</span></p><p class="sc-jVSHhB eSHvkk">Reality television star</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $1 Million</p><p>Brittany Cartwright is a reality television star known for her appearance on Vanderpump Rules as Jax Taylor's girlfriend-turned-wife.</p><p><strong>Birth Name: </strong>Brittany Nicole Cartwright</p><p><strong>Birth Date: </strong>Jan. 25, 1989</p><p><strong>Birth Place: </strong>Clark County, Ky.</p><p><strong>Mother: </strong>Sherri Lee Cartwright (n√©e Turner)</p><p><strong>Father: </strong>Donald Cecil "Don" Cartwright</p><p><strong>Spouse: </strong>Jax Taylor (m. 2019)</p><p><strong>Children: </strong>Cruz Michael Cauchi (b.

Legally, networks have to pay reality stars, although they don‚Äôt make nearly as much as actors in fiction series. As a result, we‚Äôve seen a shift towards reality on streaming networks like Netflix and Paramount.</p><p>But when Brittany joined Vanderpump Rules, she was vocal about her paycheck. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get paid my first season of Vanderpump Rules ‚Äî until the very, very end. I was broke,‚Äù Brittany said in an August 2023 episode of her podcast. ‚ÄúIt took a lot out of me. Because I had to work, I was going back and forth to see [Jax]. I was at work for a week, and then would see [Jax] the next week.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brittany Cartwright üíõ (@brittany)</a></p></figure><p>‚ÄúThis is the beginning of the show and it was costing her $800 to $900 [to travel],‚Äù Jax added. ‚ÄúShe was in Kentucky [working at a bar and Hooters] and $800 is a lot of money [to spend on flying back and forth].‚Äù After four seasons on the show, however, Brittany has had more than enough of a payout (or so it seems from her lavish lifestyle). The couple also opened a bar they now co-own called Jax's Studio City.</p><p>Brittany and Jax decided to leave Vanderpump Rules after Season 8 to focus on raising Cruz, but now that their son is going off to nursery school, the couple is ready to return to reality television. Is it for money or for reignited fame after the Scandoval? Only time (and The Valley) will tell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BqwNOapbJlk5a%2FtcPRop6hrF2jsrV51qipraA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./283845-nssf-registration-online-kenya-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>NSSF registration online in Kenya: Step-by-step guide and requirements</span></a>
