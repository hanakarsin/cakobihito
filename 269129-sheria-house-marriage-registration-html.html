In case a person possesses any other type of identification, they must provide the 21-day notice.</li><li>Widowed parties must provide the Death certificate, and those who are divorced are required to provide a divorce Decree absolute.</li><li>Alternatively, you can provide written evidence and explanation on why you can’t provide the notice.

The initial visit is usually meant to deliver a notice of the marriage which should be done 21 days prior to the stipulated marriage date. After this notice, you will be required to pay a fee of Kshs.3,300, and you will be offered a wedding date on which you would set your wedding ceremony.</li><li>The date and time: It is advisable that you be punctual on the specific appointment day. Normally, civil wedding celebrations are usually conducted from 9.00am to 3.00am on every weekday that comes after the 21-day notice has expired. In fact, by the time you arrive, you will find several other couples in the queue.</li><li>On arrival: Once you get to the office of the Registrar at Sheria House, you will be allocated a number on the queue, and you will be asked to wait for your turn from the common waiting area. Once it’s your turn, you will be called to one of the rooms where you are required to provide all details of your witnesses. You will also confirm all details as captured on the certificate soft copy before the actual printing.</li><li>At the waiting room: You will then be ushered to another waiting room next to the room set aside for the wedding alongside your guests and witnesses. Notably, you are allowed to bring a minimum of two witnesses and a maximum of 15. Here, you will have access to another changing room where brides and grooms can change into their wedding attire or apply make up to glam their civil marriage ceremony. You can’t help but notice the excitement in all the people present at this location!</li><li>The ceremony: Once it’s your turn, an officer will call out your names and those of your guests. You will then access the marriage room on one door as the couple that was right ahead of you leaves through another door. The couple and the two witnesses will sit in the front seats, and the ceremony will now commence.</li><li>The vows: You will be asked to confirm your intention and decision to get married before repeating the vows after the registrar. The registrar will then ask for the rings (of course, you’ll bring your rings with you!) and the groom will be the first one to repeat his vows. The groom will then be requested by the registrar to pale the marriage ring on his bride’s finger as the guests clap at their own pleasure. The bride will also do the same before the magical ‘you may now kiss the bride’ phrase is mentioned.</li><li>Signing the marriage certificate: You will be issued with three hard copies of the marriage certificate to sign alongside your witnesses. At this point, your guests are allowed to sing, and the registrar will sign all copies of the certificates and issue two to the couple.</li><li>Some photos to keep the memory: You will then move to one decorated side of the room for the photo session. This will be followed by lots of congratulatory handshakes and hugs before it’s time for you to exit via the other door and the officer invites another couple in the room.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1tg2s8c2h2r.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenya immigration permanent residence requirements and fees</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Notably, no cake-cutting, dancing, or popping of champagne takes place at the registrar’s office. Your guests can only go as far as singing while at this stage and location. However, you will now be free to hold the reception party at the location of your choice after the civil wedding ceremony.</p><h2>Special licenses and registrar certificates if you intend to get married in a church</h2><p class=align-left>If you intend to solemnize your marriage in church (under <a id=https://consolationafrica.wordpress.com/2014/05/02/summary-of-the-marriage-act/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cap 150 of the Marriage Act</a>), you will give Notice to your church as well as the Office of the Registrar of Marriages. Once the notice timeline of 21 days elapses, the Office of the Registrar of Marriages will issue a Registrar’s Certificate, which will be submitted to the Church Minister or the person who is in charge of officiating the marriage. Notably, you will be charged Kshs.200 for the Notice and Kshs.300 for the Registrar’s Certificate.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs4omncc13rf2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Registrar of Societies in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you are not able to provide the necessary three weeks’ notice, you will pay Kshs.5,050 for the Special License in case your marriage will be presided over by a church minister. The amount also applies to situations where the marriage ceremony takes place in a different location from the Registrar’s office or church. Such locations include a hotel, garden, etc. Notably, all marriages for non-Africans also take place under Cap 150 of the Marriage Act since most churches use the African Christian Marriage & Divorce Act, Cap 151, which isn’t applicable to non-Africans. Any marriage of non-Africans that is done under this Act is regarded to be null and void.</p><h2>Registration of customary marriage in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>If you intend to enter marriage under the Customary law, you first need to seek the relevant authorization from the government. The office of the Attorney General also made the noose tighter for those who don’t intend to legalize their marital unions by making it compulsory for those in marriages under Hindu or customary ceremonies to register the unions. The rules on Registration of Customary Marriages in Kenya were Gazzeted on 9th June 2017 under Gazette Notice Number 5345.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1q2k7iock4u8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Customary marriage in Kenya - registration, divorce, procedure</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The constitution of Kenya expressly provides for the protection of equality of marriage and family.

The court agreed to this fact, and Charles was legally married to Dorcas.</p><p class=align-left>The court noted that, since Charles and Syombua were not married, none of them had the capacity to claim ownership of a share of the property in the name of the other.
