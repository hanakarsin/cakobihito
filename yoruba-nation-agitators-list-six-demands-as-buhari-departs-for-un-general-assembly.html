This appeal is necessary so that Indigenous Nationalities in NINAS Territories can peacefully negotiate for what they want without further delay.</p><p>“Our demand remains conduct of a referendum so that the Indigenous people of the South and Middle-Belt of Nigeria can lawfully and legally decide on their nationhood and sovereignty. We demand the immediate abolition of the imposed 1999 Constitution.</p><p>“We demand an end to the genocide being perpetrated by Miyyetii Allah against our people. Miyyetii Allah is a Terrorist group and it should be declared such by the United Nations. The invasion of our land in the name of grazing is enough. What is happening in our Territories today is State-sponsored Terrorism and Land grab, not cow grazing.”</p><p>He stated that the agitators will resume protest on 24th September, Opposite the United Nations Headquarters to tell “President Muhammad Buhari to his face that his Miyyetii Allah people are the enemy number one of the people of South and Middle-Belt of Nigeria, and they are the authentic Terrorists.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5ByZrKnoqqvonnNmquip55irqi105qrqKqjYrmqv9NmqqKwXZmyrq3NnapmmaNir7a0wKugZpyVpa6zwNJmnaiqXaq7brPEp5yrmZxirrS%2FxKaZpbFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alton-brown-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Alton Brown's Net Worth in 2022?</span></a>
