We are ready to go as far as missing our first game against Canada July 21 because this has to stop”, the source said.</p><p>“On Wednesday night, we held a meeting where we agreed that we were going to find out if what we were asking for is legitimate, and that if it’s legitimate, we will press for our demands. It was what was agreed. The next meeting will be after we get the information we need and then the protest will start.”</p><p>“The General Secretary came for the meeting clutching so many papers; he told us that we won’t be paid match bonuses at the World Cup because FIFA had already given each player $30,000 for the group stage. He also said we won’t get 30 per cent from the $1,560,000 FIFA would give the NFF.”</p><p>The unnamed player added, “We were shocked, team morale went down immediately because we couldn’t believe what the man was saying.</p><p>“One of the oldest players in the team asked him if FIFA would deduct the money ($30,000) they would give us from the $1.5m they gave the federation but he (Sanusi) said no. So, she said if its like that, then it shouldn’t affect our match bonuses. After several minutes of argument, Sanusi asked us if we would have preferred the $9,000 match bonus or the $30,000 from FIFA.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49wZqytoJq%2FbrLApZqopqNiwbB5xqhkqKZdqMGztcqeZJqmlGKvsMXCqKutZWJlf3R51qippZxdmMKxew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stop-disrespecting-the-person-who-brought-you-to-power-bmo-slams-akeredolu.html><span>←</span><span>Stop Disrespecting The Person Who Brought You To Power</span></a>
