Yep, that's right — one Alabama woman was caught having a full-on meltdown, breaking the kiosk and desk at Miami International Airport. And of course, there were many people with their phones handy to catch <a href=#>it all</a> and post about it on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman destroyed a kiosk at Miami International Airport, and TikTokers were there to catch it all.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@h.manz0 href=#>@h.manz0</a><p>Miami airport part 1 <a title=miami href=#>#miami</a> <a title=miamiairport href=#>#miamiairport</a> <a title=miamiairporttantrum href=#>#miamiairporttantrum</a> <a title=HolidayOREOke href=#>#HolidayOREOke</a> <a title=welcometomiami href=#>#welcometomiami</a> <a title=part1 href=#>#part1</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Heather Lynn" href=#>♬ original sound - Heather Lynn</a></figure><p>The onlookers started to record after the woman had already made it behind the desk. Thankfully, the people on TikTok are so helpful and the commenters were able to fill in the blanks. From what we can gather, this woman was flying from Birmingham, Alabama to New York City, with a layover in Miami. When she went to check into her connecting flight, her two children wandered off to go to the bathroom and she wasn't able to find them. Consequently, they missed their flight.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ppvtahoe href=#>@ppvtahoe</a><p>Miami Airport tantrum / Woman arrested at MIA has meltdown for messing up computers</p><a title="♬ original sound - ppvtahoe" href=#>♬ original sound - ppvtahoe</a></figure><p>At some point, the woman began demanding that the person behind the desk find her children. We have not found a video where she moves to be behind the desk, but in this video, you can clearly hear her saying over and over again, "Find my children, bro."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@mohamedshouman985 href=#>@mohamedshouman985</a><p>Wild lady chasing American Airlines worker! <a title=miamiairport href=#>#miamiairport</a> <a title=miamitantrum href=#>#miamitantrum</a> <a title=miami href=#>#Miami</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - mohamedshouman985" href=#>♬ original sound - mohamedshouman985</a></figure><p>The woman even goes so far as to chase the gate agent down the jet bridge, throwing a suitcase on her way back.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@mark_d4life href=#>@mark_d4life</a><p>Destroyed Agents desk. <a title=meltdowns href=#>#meltdowns</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - mark_d4life" href=#>♬ original sound - mark_d4life</a></figure><p>You can continue to watch the woman <a href=#>getting more and more upset</a>. When she comes back from the jet bridge, the woman starts to destroy the desk, ripping the computer out and throwing it. She begins addressing the people watching, who seem to all have their phones out recording the incident. She comes back to completely knock over the kiosk that scans people's tickets and continues to rip apart the desk. A good Samaritan even attempts to calm her down but to no avail.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@businessfunding4u href=#>@businessfunding4u</a><p>LADY FREAKING OUT IN THE MIAMI AIRPORT <a title=miami href=#>#MIAMI</a> <a title=airport href=#>#AIRPORT</a> <a title=crazy href=#>#CRAZY</a> <a title=calmdown href=#>#CALMDOWN</a> <a title=popo href=#>#POPO</a> <a title=50 href=#>#50</a> <a title=gohome href=#>#GOHOME</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - COACH RON" href=#>♬ original sound - COACH RON</a></figure><p>It's unclear how long her tirade goes on for, but eventually the police come. She attempts to climb over the desk, but she's taken away in handcuffs. It seems like she's saying "get my kids" over and over as she's being carted off.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> reports that the woman is currently in custody by the local police and "charged with aggravated battery, criminal mischief, and disorderly conduct."</p><p>This honestly just makes us sad. While she very clearly reacted in a way that is never OK and endangered those around her, she was a very distraught mother having a meltdown over her lost children. We hope her kids are safe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaiuchmmKKqoKS%2FtXnWqKSapl2ZsrTA0aiwrGWbnry0t4ytoKSsn6A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-erica-meyer-krqe.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened to Erica Meyer From KRQE in Albuquerque?</span></a>
