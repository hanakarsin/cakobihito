It was a senator, who is very close to the presidency that actually took Lawan to Asiwaju in Lagos, in company with another prominent party leader.</i></p><p><i>“Tinubu, categorically told the two gentlemen in the presence of Lawan that his choice was Akume and pledged to consult with other party leaders before he would give his final answer to their request to support Lawan.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Buhari’s One-term Pledge, APC Leaders Fight Dirty</p><p><i>“I was in the know of all the process that led to the emergence of Lawan and Gbajabiamila as consensus candidates. Tinubu played the role because of his loyalty to the party. I was among the four people that he sent to beg Akume, since he had already promised to support him.</i></p><p><i>“The campaign of calumny against Asiwaju was a grand conspiracy to tarnish Tinubu’s image because some people were no longer comfortable with his ever growing influence and goodwill within the party, which he earned over the years as a result of his generosity and selfless service.</i></p><p><i>“It was when their wicked campaign against Lawan because of Asiwaju’s support for him failed, that they connived with the Peoples Democratic Party to rebel against the party’s consensus candidates of Lawan and Gbajabiamila.”</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXd%2Fj2lwZqyZo8KjwYydoJ2mpGK2rrzOrJxmpJGsrq95xpuYo5mSnq6utcuaZKimXZa9pHnBqKmonpaesKZ6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-on-the-spectrum-us-cast-instagrams.html><span>←</span><span>Catch up With the Love on the Spectrum U.S.' Cast on Instagram</span></a>
