Needless to say, there are multiple streams of revenue that he has managed to acquire over the years.</p><p>In addition to work that Dylan has done himself, there have been multiple biopics made in his name as well, which only adds to the amount of money he has made over the course of his decades-long career in the entertainment industry. In 2007, I'm Not There was released with multiple people playing various versions of Dylan throughout his career.
