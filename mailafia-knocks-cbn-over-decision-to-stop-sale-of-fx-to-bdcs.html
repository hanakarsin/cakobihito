Old habits, I don’t think they change. Leopards are very unlikely to change their spots.</p><p>“So, we may end up in a scenario where there is scarcity and the simple economics of demand and supply tells you that where there is increase scarcity, price is likely to shoot up.</p><p>“If bank bureaucracy makes it difficult for people to access dollar, what it means is that the bureaucracies, obstacles and bottlenecks are likely to put pressure on supply and pressure on supply may mean an increase in demand for the dollar and greater fall of the naira, if we don’t play the cards well.”</p><p>He added: “How can you totally trust these commercial banks because most of them will want to corner the dollar for themselves and whatever is left, then they can now share with the market at a rate they want?” he queried.</p><p>“On the naira, it is not just the underlying economic fundamentals that matters like interest rate, inflation and so on, these things matter and the level of debt affect it but there are the non-quantifiable elements like violence, instability, rural banditry and terrorism, those things undermine the productive capacity of the economy.</p><p>“They also destroy social capital, the trust that holds the community together to do businesses together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FyZqaZmaGup7XAZqKnp5OgwG6vwadkqK6Vp3qlscKiqqKnnmLBsHnSraapZaOWuaZ5zp9kn7BdqbxursOcqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./immabeast-html.html><span>←</span><span>immaBEAST - Members, Ages, Trivia</span></a>
