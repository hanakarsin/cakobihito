People deal with confrontation in different ways. Some ignore it completely and just try to extricate themselves from a situation as soon as possible. Others become overly aggressive and lash out in ways that are disproportionate to the situation.</p><p>Then you have people so passive aggressive, it's almost beautiful to watch them in action.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. This guy's live-tweet of two customers at war is a perfect example.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>This "Dirty Plates Woman" — or "DPW" as she will be called later — incited all of the drama when she made this bold and possibly intentional move.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Stuart confirmed that, yes, there were plenty of other empty tables where she could've moved the dirty plates. But she chose the one occupied by another woman.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. "Clean Woman" wasn't having any of it, however.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>In my opinion, she acted totally rationally and made sure to let DPW know that she wasn't having any of her ridiculous plate-moving behavior.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>For some reason, DPW thought she was well within her rights to move the plates to CPW's table. That's when the argument began.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">5. Cafe staff did their best to stay out of it.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Who can blame them? These are adults here who can fend for themselves and solve their own issues, right?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">6.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Then, a wonderful plate-swapping ballet commenced, with both women refusing to acknowledge each other's existence for a spell. Instead, they just moved the dishes from table to table in silence.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">7.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>A mug became the first casualy in the fight, and DPW pretended like she didn't see anything, seeking shelter behind her book. No one bothers someone who's reading, right?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">8.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Stuart and the staff in the establishment can't remain silent on the matter any longer; they need to get involved.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">9.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>DPW's game of silence seems to be working. All parties involved are befuddled by her decision to simply disengage from the situation. It's like the grown-up equivalent of a toddler dropping to the ground and becoming dead weight.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">10. But a line in the sand was drawn.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Stuart had to take sides and gave his support to CPW. This didn't go unnoticed by DPW, who stared him down as well.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">11. Then the book group walked in.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>All of the fuss seems to have boiled over, except, as fate would have it....</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">12. Both women are in the same book club.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>If you thought things were dramatic before, just wait for all of this delicious pettiness to unfold now that it turns out they're going to be at the same table for their meeting.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">13.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>DPW again plays it noncommittal. She doesn't know anyone here. As far as she's concerned, CPW made the entire plate thing up. Imagine how many people DPW has gaslit in her life, my God.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">14. But CPW wasn't interested in keeping quiet.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>She blew up DPW's spot but, again, the dirty plates bandit stayed quiet, further adding to the confusion of everyone involved.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">15.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Things only got worse from there. DPW started laying the charm on other people in the group, acting like she's totally not the kind of person who just puts their dirty plates on someone else's table.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">16.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Things appeared to calm down after a while, and there was a moment where life almost imitated art.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">17.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>And then it totally did imitate art, and the drama started to pick up again. CPW apparently just had to make a move.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">18.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>So she did: she bought some cake and tea and put the dirty cup and plate on top of DPW's book. Vengeance was hers.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">19.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>From this moment forward, it was on.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">20. And DPW didn't pull any punches.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>DPW engaged the classic accidental-but-really-on-purpose water spill, ruining CPW's book, before sitting back down to &nbsp;watch the madness unfold.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">21.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>The team innocently joined together to clean the mess up. DPW didn't lift a finger.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">22. CPW subtly throws this jab in.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Way for her to slide that insult into the context of the book club. Pro-level move right there.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">23.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>But it wasn't enough for her, she needed a way to actually get back at DPW, especially because she started it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">24.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Honestly, this guy should get a job in marketing because that's a brilliant idea.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">25.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p><br></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">26. CPW sees her shot and takes it.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>But it's to no avail.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">27.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Patrick is completely clueless about the comment CPW made and DPW laughs it off like her rival is just a bit touched.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">28.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Stuart wanted to extend the drama a little bit more. Frankly, this low-stakes kind of anguish is too good not to savor it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">29.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">30.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Obviously this isn't the real "ending" whatsoever.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">31. The actual way it ends seems a bit anti-climactic.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>DPW completely ignores CPW, which bothers the woman with the clean table to no end, apparently.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">32.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>Stuart, thinking the whole thing is finally over, breathes a sigh of finality.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">33. BUT WAIT!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>THERE'S MORE.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">34. DPW pulled this absolutely brutal finishing move.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>There's no better way to assert your dominance over someone than by paying their bill. Hot damn, that was some tasty book club cafe drama.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6nsYybpqijXZi5tq6MnamapZE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./akeredolu-knocks-bauchi-governor-for-justifying-herdsmen-carrying-guns.html><span>←</span><span>Akeredolu Knocks Bauchi Governor For Justifying Herdsmen Carrying Guns</span></a>
