Read below:</p><p><strong>1. Professor Chinedu Nebo:</strong> The former Vice Chancellor of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka has indeed been outstanding. The Minister of Power have overseen a tedious privatisation process of the power sector devoid of rancour as was the case in the past. He has also been consistent with his regular briefing of the media and Nigerians in order to keep everyone up-to-date on the progress in the sector. Though not much have been achieved yet, Nigerians will no doubt start to see the manifestation of his handiwork in the nearest future, provided the incoming Buhari administration continues from where he stopped and make corrections where he made mistakes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt7m7ejauqea9.jpeg><p><strong>2. Dr. Omobola Johnson:</strong> It is not really a surprise that she has performed well. Not your typical politician, Johnson left her position as the Country Manager of Accenture to take assume the role of Nigeria's Minister of Communications. Her sterling performance and revolutionary policies are visible for all to see. She has also focused heavily on empowering young girls in Information Communication Technology and it has paid off immensely.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt2n59pmu4jts.jpeg><p><strong>3. Ambassador Aminu Wali:</strong> The Kano-born former Nigerian Ambassador to China has brought to bear his diplomatic experience at the foreign ministry. A perfect gentleman, his robust foreign policies have seen Nigeria,for the first time, stand up to ungrateful countries like South-Africa, United Arab Emirates and some Asian countries. Wali has done a good job in standing for the rights of Nigerians abroad although much still needs to be done in this direction. But he has started on a right note, and it is expected that whoever fills his big shoes in the Buhari administration, will continue from where he stopped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4f3bdf5n3ma.jpeg><p><strong>4. Osita Chidoka:</strong> Chidoka's short stint in the Ministry of Aviation has proven that saying that says <i>"It is not how far, but how well".</i> The former head of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) hit the ground running immediately he assumed office. In an industry that has been under consistent crisis, Chidoka became a rallying point for all the stakeholders in the industry mostly because of the professional way he handled issues pertaining the industry. He has worked tirelessly to improve on the safety standards of the industry and has carried on working despite Jonathan's loss at the polls. Nigeria definitely need men like Chidoka in&nbsp; public service.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt9ojdogmmab4.jpeg><p><strong>5. Dr. Akinwunmi Adeshina:</strong> This list would not be complete without the name of Dr. Adeshina. It is not for nothing that he is currently one of the leading contenders&nbsp;for the role of the president of Africa Development Bank (ADB). Adeshina's revolutionary achievements in the agricultural sector has opened up &nbsp;opportunities in the sector that was hitherto comatose and begging for attention. From the availability of fertilizers to the ordinary farmers, to the loans available to them and the investment flowing into the sector, Akinwunmi is no doubt the most outstanding Minister under Jonathan and he should be proud of himself. One can only wish him luck in his aspiration to lead the ADB.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt5d5gafh04ji.jpeg><p>Meanwhile, President-elect Muhammadu Buhari<a href=#> this week made his first appointment</a> by making Femi Adeshina his special adviser on Media and Publicity.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXV%2FlGpwZm1dn7yvrdOhmKerXaK2r7XSrZyrq12ptaLAjKmcq56fp7qmsIywnKWkXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1202391-top-10-presidents-governors-world-countries-html.html><span>←</span><span>Top 10 best presidents (governors) in the world and their countries</span></a>
