Maybe it's simply that they're plain fun, period.</p><p>The newest horror icon in this category is a life-sized AI doll named M3GAN, and she's gaining a lot of online attention.</p><p>Directed by Gerard Johnstone and produced by horror legends James Wan, Jason Blum, Michael Clear, and Couper Samuelson, <a href=#>M3GAN</a> follows toy roboticist Gemma (Allison Williams), who is suddenly thrust into the life of her 8-year-old niece, Cady (Violet McGraw), after Cady's parents are killed in a tragic accident. Now, Gemma must act as Cady's new guardian, despite knowing little to nothing about parenting.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Universal Pictures</span></figure><p>At her high-pressure job, Gemma is working on a prototype for the aforementioned android doll, which is intended to be a child's closest and most protective companion. As M3GAN (Amie Donald) absorbs information about the child she latches onto — in this case, Cady — "she becomes friend and teacher, playmate and protector," a feature that eventually proves to boast sinister consequences. Have we learned nothing from <a href=#>Black Mirror</a>?</p><p>Despite it being a horror movie — one with a shocking <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a> score of 96 percent — the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trailers for M3GAN</a> are chock-full of meme-able material, and the Twittersphere has taken note. From M3GAN's TikTok-esque dance moves to the inclusion of <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>'s "It's Nice to Have a Friend," here are the wackiest M3GAN memes out there.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A quick 'wikiHow' tutorial.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>how to protect ur bestie <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/uiSs0LelFd</a></p>— M3GAN (@meetM3GAN) <a href=#>December 22, 2022</a></figure><p>The official 'M3GAN' Twitter account gifted us with this quality meme.

Perhaps M3GAN herself will come for us for doubting her abilities.</p><p>The Blumhouse flick boasts a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score of 96 percent with 54 reviews as of this writing, which is more than certain superhero movies can say (we're looking at you, <a href=#>Morbius</a>).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We aren't going to argue with Wendy Williams.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>everybody’s talking about <a href=#>#M3GAN</a>! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YoXaKDpuOS</a></p>— SPOOK-cer BOO-rrett (@spencerbarrett) <a href=#>October 11, 2022</a></figure><p>"She's got a point, she's an icon, she's a legend, and she is the moment."
