During the lockdown, their planes were moving up and down as if there was no lockdown,” Mailafia noted.</p><p>When asked if the government was unwilling or unable to protect the people of Kaduna, Mailafiya said; “In fact, it is not only unable, but it is also unwilling and we have good reason to feel that they are part and parcel of the killers let me make some revelations to you.</p><p>“How will a government just say it is revenge killings and so on, then you leave it there because it is revenge killings and so on. The body language of this administration, the body language of the state government shows clearly that they have a hand in the killings, no doubt about it.</p><p>“Let me make some revelations because some of us also have our intelligence networks, have met with some of the bandits, we have met with some of their high commanders, one or two who have repented, they have sat down with us, not once, not twice. They told us one of the Northern governors is the Commander of Boko Haram in Nigeria”.</p><p>Mailafia died today at the National Hospital in Abuja.</p><p>Whether his claims are true or are just mere speculations, the security situations in the country are far from good.</p><p><strong>Who is (are) the sponsor (s) of Boko Haram in Nigeria?</strong> <strong>Naija News</strong> leaves you with this question.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5ByZp%2Bkkai1o63CpGSompGZtqK0jKaYoqSRm7aiv4ycpqeelajAqrvNZpibp6WpeqO7yqhkoZmilrpuv8%2Bopaynoqh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marla-catherine-html.html><span>←</span><span>Marla Catherine Henry - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
