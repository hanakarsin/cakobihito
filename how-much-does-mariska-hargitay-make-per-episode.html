Fans want to know exactly how much her hard work paid off. So, <a href=#>how much does Mariska Hargitay make per episode</a> of Law & Order: SVU?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: USA</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much does Mariska Hargitay make per episode?</h2><p>As it stands, Mariska is the highest-paid actress on Law & Order: SVU, with an estimated net worth of $100 million. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>, the actress earns anywhere from $500,000 to $540,00 per episode. With 22 episodes, her net pay per season is more than $11 million. And a glimpse at her resume proves that she earned it.</p><p>In 2005, Mariska won a Golden Globe award for best performance by an actress in a drama series. The following year, Mariska became the first cast member to win a Primetime Emmy for outstanding lead actress in a drama series. Additionally, Mariska has directed several episodes of SVU and is now an executive producer for the series.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: USA</span></figure><p>Further, Mariska made a cameo in the 2005 video game, True Crime: New York City, where she voiced Lieutenant Deena Dixon, as well as in Taylor Swift’s music video for “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad Blood</a>”, which later won a VMA for Video of the Year in 2015.</p><p>A lot has changed for Mariska since she rose to fame in the late '90s — especially her bank account.

The actor left after the network allegedly cut his salary by $2 million per year. It’s unclear how much showrunners agreed to pay Chris upon his return.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: USA</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 23 of 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' airs on Sept. 23.</h2><p>On Sept 23, Season 23 of SVU premieres on USA. In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TODAY</a>, Mariska hinted that Benson and Stabler might be partners again, at last. But not in the way you’d think.</p><p>A photo recently surfaced online that teased a romantic relationship between Mariska and Chris, but the co-stars confirmed their relationship is strictly platonic. Benson and Stabler, on the other hand, are a different story.</p><p>Tune into the Season 23 premiere of Law & Order: SVU on Sept. 23 at 9 p.m. EST on USA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFllKSytHnMmqmiq5uWeqmt0aCgrZmpYrqit8Rmp56qXZq9qr%2FOnZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pdp-crisis-wike-insists-on-only-thing-he-wants-from-ayu.html><span>←</span><span>Wike Insists On Only Thing He Wants From Ayu</span></a>
