That is not a secret anymore but we have no interest in pretending that it is not a problem.</p><p>“But what we need in the country now, asides from an effective strategy to deal in finality with the issue of insecurity, is a thinking and intellectual opposition in the country.</p><p>“If you heard the chants, it was ‘’Lawan must go’’, ‘Buhari must go’. That is what they were saying.</p><p>“We need to let go of gimmickry in this country. Gimmicks are not going to solve our problem.</p><p>“If we have an intellectual opposition in this country, what they will be thinking about doing or working towards is even if it is to engage international security consultants to come up with a clear plan, implementable plan.’’</p><p>Reacting to a comment that the PDP has in the past offered advice on how to tackle insecurity in the country but it was not adhered to, he said, ‘’What are those suggestions? Are those suggestions that the President should resign? Are the suggestions that the Security chiefs should be sacked? These are the kind of simple minded statements and solutions that don’t lead anywhere.</p><p>“We spent almost four or five years asking the President to sack the previous service chiefs and that if we do that, all will be Uhuru. That is what our opposition made us to believe. They were sacked, they were replaced. We began to see gains and everything. Now we are having a different sort of problem coming up.</p><p>“The solution is it to sack everybody? If you go to the United States now where you have school shootings, in the malls, shooting everywhere, nobody is saying Joe Biden should resign. They are looking at what is it that should do to solve this problem.’’</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FxZqKmo5qwtr7IrbBmraNitaK%2FjKemrWWRqLimsIyboJ2dnmLBsHnRnqqin55ir7a0wKugrGWRnrGmedKlmKarXaWxsXnSnqWarJ%2BnwG671Z6pZqiipL2wv8SdZKKloJqupLTMnqWtZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./2023-i-can-perform-better-than-buhari-102-year-old-presidential-aspirant-ezeanyaeche-declares.html><span>←</span><span>2023: I Can Perform Better Than Buhari</span></a>
