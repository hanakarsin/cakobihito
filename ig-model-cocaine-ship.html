A cool premise. Plenty of "preparation montages" where you see bits of the plan come together, but not the whole picture until it's executed.</p><p>But the best part of heist movies are the OMG moments. Just when you think the protagonists are going to get caught, some quick, on-the-feet thinking, or pure luck or chance or circumstance extricates them from it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><p>Now there are some people who take their love of heists movies a little too far and use the films as a means of fooling themselves into believing that they, too, could pull off a great crime. They'll have a foolproof plan, they'll do it all with confidence, they'll make the necessary connections, and they'll reap the benefits.</p><p>The problem is though, most people don't get caught in heist movies and if they do, it's because of some stupid mistake that could've easily been avoided. Now I don't know if Instagram model Mélina Roberge and Isabelle Lagace ever watched a heist film or not, but it might explain why she thought it was a good idea to try and smuggle 31 kilos of cocaine onto an Australian cruise ship back in August of 2016.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: instagram</a></figure><p>Drug mules aren't exactly new - there are plenty of people who make a living smuggling drugs for rich dealers who are smart enough to not get their hands dirty. What is new, however, in Roberge's case is that she's one of the few people where Instagram was apparently a motivating factor in her crimes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A Canadian drug mule who tried to help smuggle $21M worth of cocaine into Sydney on a cruise ship will spend at least four years in jail. Melina Roberge pleaded guilty in February on the eve of her trial for importing nearly 30 kilograms of the drugs. <a href=#>https://t.co/KWbXLzSrXa</a></p>— 7 News Sydney (@7NewsSydney) <a href=#>April 18, 2018</a></figure><p>At least that's what judge Catherine Traill said&nbsp;when she sentenced Roberge to eight years in prison for her part in the transportation of the huge cocaine shipment.</p><p>Roberge, in court, told Traill that the primary reason she went on the trip is so she could hyped herself on Instagram and get approval from other people, something the judge thought was pretty stupid.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Accused Canadian drug smugglers show off luxury cruise holiday before arrest in Sydney. <a href=#>https://t.co/RnUoDoFaA8</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bqBzUTNwEW</a></p>— 7 News Sydney (@7NewsSydney) <a href=#>August 31, 2016</a></figure>It is sad they seek to attain such a vacuous existence where how many likes they receive is their currency. She wanted to be the envy of others. I doubt she is now the envy of others," Traill said.<p>Roberge went on to say that the trip wasn't her idea. Her 65-year-old sugar daddy, André Tamine, back in Quebec instructed her to make the trafficking attempt seem like a glamorous vacation. However, Tamine, Lagacé, and Roberge were all arrested when they made it to Australia on August 28th, 2016.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: instagram</a></figure><p>Drug-sniffing dogs didn't just find 30 kilograms in the women's cabin, but also 65 kilos in Tamine's room as well. As of now, Tamine has yet to be sentenced - his ruling is coming in October. Lagacé is getting seven years and six months - around the same amount as her travel companion - for her part in the crime.</p><p>The part of this story that's getting a lot of people worked up though, is how far the 24-year-old went just to flex for social media.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Judge Kate Traill on sentencing Instagram-enthusiast & cocaine importer, Melina Roberge: “It is sad they seek to attain such a vacuous existence where how many likes they receive are their currency.” <a href=#>https://t.co/GP9lLfnAeA</a> via <a href=#>@candacesutton1</a> <a href=#>@newscomauHQ</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Vz4KKhZ0pG</a></p>— Melissa Hoyer (@melissahoyer) <a href=#>April 18, 2018</a></figure><p>There has to be a reason why a lot of people are highlighting that comment from Judge Traill.
