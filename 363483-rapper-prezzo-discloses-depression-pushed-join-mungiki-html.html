So after tupendane, next was all the Mama Zari vibe. And Mama Zari loved Ng’echu but she hated Prezzo,'' he said.<p class=align-left>Prezzo said he was forced to leave his wife with his daughter in their mansion and moved in a penthouse because she wanted him to stop doing music and switch to another profession.</p>''“At that time Daisy Mama Zari, loved Ng’echu but she hated Prezzo and she wanted me to stop doing music and probably be an accountant or a teacher somewhere, a carpenter anything but not music. And I was like I spent so much time building this brand and I am not gonna just leave it like that. So from that point on wards, I left them with that mansion that I was living in and I took another penthouse. So for also most a year I lost myself. For one year, I used to have my bodyguard bringing me food, bringing me whatever I need in the house, I never left the house for a whole year. It was like I was in a house arrest and slowly getting into depression,” he added.<p class=align-left>He added that it was at that moment when he was hit by a bout of depression that saw him locking himself up in his penthouse for a year, with his bodyguards being his connection with the outside world.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: My grandson caught COVID-19 after attending a party - Grandpa weeps</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Nakuru: Kijogoo atemwa na mke kwa kuchovya asali ya kijakazi wao</p><p class=align-left>However, he was able to come out of the situation stronger and kept releasing hits.</p><p class=align-left>It is through the same interview that he also revealed he was once a member of Mungiki.</p><p class=align-left>Prezzo said he was asked by the then chairman Maina Njenga to join the group as a youth leader, an offer he accepted.</p>''So after one year I received a call from a brother called Andrew Nyanja, saying 'chairman would like to meet you, Maina Njenga would like to me you'. I asked why and the guy said just come to Karen. So he wanted a meeting with me. I was asking myself so many questions...I was like what is it that chairman wants to talk to me about. So we went to Karen and Maina Njenga had this movement and he needed me to be like youth leader of the Mungikis and who am I to say No. So he gave me responsibilities and I was in the whole nine years,'' he said.<p class=align-left>The rapper wedded Daisy in 2008 in a star-studded wedding but parted way years later over what he just shared above.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a hot story or scandal you would like us to publish, please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690 and Telegram: </i></strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tuko news.</a></p><p class=align-left><strong><i>I married a man every woman wanted - Pastor Joan Chege | Tuko Talks </i></strong>| Tuko TV.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FlWxrcWtdp66xvMSrZKmqla%2FHsHnDoqqcpJ%2BosrR5w56nq52jqLawuoyprKyglZl6q7vIp2SmrZ6ctqy1jaGrpqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1342335-park-bom-bio-age-net-worth-weight-gain-plastic-surgery-html.html><span>←</span><span>Park Bom bio: Age, net worth, weight gain, plastic surgery</span></a>
