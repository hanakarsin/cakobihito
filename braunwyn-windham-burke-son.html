In her Season 14 debut, she introduced the world to her brood of seven kids, her unconventional marriage to husband Sean Burke (and his epic statement necklaces), and her eccentric mom, Dr. Deb. With such a unique life, it's no surprise that Braunwyn soon became a breakout star.</p><p>Though she "took" O.G. RHOC star <a href=#>Vicki Gunvalson</a>'s orange, Braunwyn managed to win fans over by being an open book on the show. For Season 15, she'll be, once again, baring it all when it comes to her marriage. She's also set to chronicle her son, Jacob's experience with drag.&nbsp;</p><p>Who is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Braunwyn Windham-Burke's son, Jacob?</a> He'll be a big part of his mom's storyline.

During the trailer for RHOC, Jacob shared that his drag name is Divine DeVonne.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in January of 2020, Braunwyn shared on The Daily Dish podcast that the 15-year-old became more interested in drag the month prior.</p><p>"Jacob asked for heels for Christmas, and I said, 'OK,' and that sort of started it," Braunwyn said. "I have found out there's an entire community of teenagers that are in the drag community that I didn’t know about, and I've reached out to a lot of their moms."</p><p>She later shared that he was learning techniques and makeup tricks by watching videos online. During the COVID-19 quarantine, Jacob had been putting on shows and performances for his family members.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality star opened up about what a positive outlet drag had become for her son on the podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>"He was kind of in a funk for a while, he was kind of depressed and just sad," she explained. "This has taken him out of that. He's just activated and alive."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Who are Braunwyn Windham-Burke's other kids?</h2><p>During her first episode on RHOC, Braunwyn shocked her co-stars when she revealed that she was a mom to seven children.
