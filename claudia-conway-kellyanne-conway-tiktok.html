"[George and I] disagree about plenty but we are united on what matters most: the kids. Our four children are teens and tweens starting a new academic year, in middle school and high school, remotely from home for at least a few months. As millions of parents nationwide know, kids 'doing school from home' requires a level of attention and vigilance that is as unusual as these times."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm Leaving the White House.
