Fans are now wondering if Ne-Yo has a string of failed relationships. Has Ne-Yo been married before? Who is his first wife?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@itscrystalsmith</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Ne-Yo’s first wife?</h2><p>While Ne-Yo was previously engaged to Monyetta Shaw, his marriage to Crystal Smith is the first and only time the “Miss Independent” singer has jumped the broom. However, in July 2022, Crystal announced, via Instagram, that their relationship was ending after finding out Ne-Yo had been unfaithful.</p><p>The singer responded to her Instagram post on <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> the following day, writing: "For the sake of our children, my family and I will work through our challenges behind closed doors. Personal matters are not meant to be addressed and dissected in public forums."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Crystal Smith (@itscrystalsmith)</a></p></figure><p>Interestingly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reports that not only has Crystal officially filed for divorce from Ne-Yo, but she has listed July 22, 2022 as their official separation date. The entrepreneur cites infidelity that resulted in a child as one of the reasons for their split. The site shares that Crystal filed documents sometime during the week of Aug. 1, 2022.</p><p>In the documents obtained by the outlet, Crystal shares that their "marriage is irretrievably broken with no hope for reconciliation."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ne-Yo’s wife Crystal Smith with a message!!! <a href=#>#neyo</a> <a href=#>#cheater</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8rQF7jWW6b</a></p>— Righteous&Ratchet (@RighteousRatch1) <a href=#>July 31, 2022</a></figure><p>Unfortunately, this is not the couple's first rodeo with divorce proceedings. In 2020, Crystal filed for divorce after the couple went public with their problems. This came after Ne-Yo announced his plans to <a href=# style=text-align:start>file for divorce</a> in February 2020.</p><p>Ne-Yo told <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Private Talk</a>, “She’s got demons just like everybody else, just like me. We realize that our demons don’t mesh and until both of us get a hold of our personal demons it just makes things difficult.”</p><p>Ne-Yo and Crystal made it clear that they were over in 2020, but the two reconciled before the end of the year. In an interview with Tamron Hall, Ne-Yo explained, “I was really, really broken up about it, but I felt like I couldn’t show that to the world. My pride wouldn’t allow me to show that to her initially. But I think she kind of knew where I was at."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by NE-YO (@neyo)</a></p></figure><p>The singer continued, "So I’m not about to waste what could potentially be maybe our last moments together not together. I’m not doing it. I’m going where my home is, I’m going where my heart is. And that was it.”</p><p>The pair went on to have a second wedding celebration in Las Vegas in April 2022 and all seemed well until now.</p><p style=text-align:start>Along with his three children with Crystal, Ne-Yo also shares two children with his ex fiancée, Monyetta.</p><p style=text-align:start>Crystal and Ne-Yo first jumped the broom in 2016 shortly after welcoming their first child, Shaffer Chimere Smith Jr.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">After a rocky run in the tabloids, Ne-Yo’s wife, Crystal, and his ex-partner, Monyetta Shaw, have developed a friendship.</h2><p>Before Ne-Yo and Crystal were married, the singer was in a long-time partnership with Monyetta, the mother of his two older children. According to reports, Ne-Yo ended his relationship with Monyetta, who claimed that she had her tubes tied at the request of the singer when they were together because he no longer wanted to be monogamous.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>While there was initially bad blood between Crystal and Monyetta, they have since resolved their issues in the interest of their children. Monyetta said in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>, "I didn't know how to maneuver in the space of a single mom. First, I was freaking out! Like OK, wait, no! Let's do counseling! Why don't you want me? What's going on? And then I had to understand that life happens and that's not going to be my story [of the victim]. So I had to lift myself up and get it together."</p><p>Monyetta later <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote a book</a> about the beauty of blended families.</p><p>Like it or not, divorce can get messy, very quickly. That said, we'd like to wish both Crystal and Ne-Yo all the best moving forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo7Juxc5mnaKqo6l6uLXFng%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corporations-buying-up-all-homes.html><span>←</span><span>Corporations Buying Up All Homes, Causing Housing Issues Nationwide</span></a>
