The difference is being carried in the books of NNPC, and we may no longer be able to carry that burden.”</p><p>He added that NNPC is “currently the sole importer of PMS, and we’re trying to exit the underpriced sale of PMS. Eventual exit is inevitable, when it will happen I cannot say, but engagements are ongoing because government is cognisant of the implications.”</p><p>“Nigeria’s current PMS consumption – i.e. evacuation from NNPC depots – is about 60 million Litres per day. Cheapest PMS price in any of our neighbours is above N300 per Litre, up to N500 in some countries,” he noted.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>GMD NNPC: NNPC importing PMS at market price & selling at N162/L.
