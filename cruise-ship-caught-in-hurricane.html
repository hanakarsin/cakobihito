That was the reality for folks aboard a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Caribbean</a> "Independence of the Seas" cruise in June 2023. The cruise, which hadn’t even left its dock in Port Canaveral, Fla., yet, had people holding on for dear life as heavy gusts of winds tried to throw them aboard.</p><p>A few <a href=#>TikTok</a> users who were there captured videos at the scene and it’s clear that the weather woke up that morning and chose violence. Below, we share those videos of what down as well as how Royal Caribbean handled the scary situation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/Royal Caribbean Blog</a><p>An Independence of the Seas cruise ship (right) featured on the Royal Caribbean Blog's YouTube channel.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Passengers claim Royal Caribbean didn’t acknowledge the storm.</h2><p>TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@lucassparrow1110</a>, who fortunately appeared to be inside the ship while filming, shared a video of the absolute chaos that could be seen out the windows.</p><p>Umbrellas were flipped over while multiple beach chairs were seen flying through the air. A guy who was running to seek shelter was pushed to the ground by the wind. People were gripping the ship’s taffrail with all their might to avoid being blown away. And in the background, a woman’s voice can be heard screaming “Get the kids.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@lucassparrow1110 href=#>@lucassparrow1110</a><p>Just a fun evening leaving Port Canaveral this past Friday.

She appeared to be outside during the storm, but remained protected under one of the ship's roofs.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@cornettahh href=#>@cornettahh</a><p>Small but mighty squall hit us before we even left Port Canaveral.

She immediately ran off with her kid leaving the stroller behind.</p><p>TikTok users were relieved to know that the young child was OK.</p><p>"That was a direct hit to the stroller. Good thing she was holding the baby," wrote one user. Cora replied that she felt like her heart had stopped until she realized there wasn't a child in the stroller.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Another user wrote: "Hurricane season. You couldn't pay me to go on a cruise during the summer."</p><p>Meanwhile, some folks seemed frustrated that people were acting shocked in the comment section. "Oceans have storms people. Don't be surprised when Earth does its thing."</p><p>Royal Caribbean provided Distractify with the following statement regarding this cruise. It read: "On Friday, June 16, while departing from Port Canaveral, 'Independence of the Seas' encountered a sudden gust of high winds. This lasted for a brief period and there were no serious injuries to our guests or crew."</p><p>The statement continued: "'Independence of the Seas' continued its regularly scheduled three-night itinerary, arriving to Perfect Day at CocoCay in The Bahamas, on Saturday morning, as scheduled."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmL%2B2tdKeZKygmaV6pK3UoJ%2BtZZmjeqnB0augnJmemg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-maggie-coming-back-fbi.html><span>←</span><span>Special Agent Maggie Bell Is Coming Back to 'FBI' Sooner Than You Think</span></a>
