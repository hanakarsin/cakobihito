America's more politically divided than ever, despite Trump's promises to be a unifying president during his campaign trail and right up to his inauguration into the Oval Office.
A lot of that political divide has to do with racism and the reaction to that racism. Discussions about police brutality against non-white citizens and protesting that brutality, turns into a conversation about being patriotic or not."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

There are obviously a lot of people who are utterly flabbergasted that such clearly hateful ideology is being protected and supported in the USA, so there's a lot of push against this disgusting racism.</p><p>Unfortunately, though, that leads to race-baiting, and jumping to conclusions whenever someone sees something that appears to be unjust. Which is unfortunately what seemingly happened when the NBA tweeted out this touching photo of Santa Fe students who were given free Houstin Rockets tickets after suffering a school shooting massacre that killed 10 of their peers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>#SantaFeStrong</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/j5ALaQ8N4L</a></p>— NBA (@NBA) <a href=#>May 25, 2018</a></figure><p>In the photo, people noticed that all of the white students were holding hands, while the only black girl in the shot was standing, deep in thought, not holding anyone else's hand.</p><p>Which some people were quick to call "racism" on.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Who the white girls?? Yeah they did have one job and refused to hold the black chicks hand...their racisms showing BIG TIME.</p>— the names dey but you pronounce it day (@DeyAndNight) <a href=#>May 26, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>But why is Nobody holding the black girls hand.... <a href=#>https://t.co/zfmhvqY3sw</a></p>— JARBAS🇧🇷 (@jarbasfaria) <a href=#>May 25, 2018</a></figure><p>The thing about the social media accounts is that pretty much anyone can have one if they want. And if you write something about someone that gets a lot of shares, then it's bound to catch the attention of a person who knows the subject personally.</p><p>In the case of this "black girl" in the photo, her mother found the tweet and resoundingly told the person in question to mind their business because they had no idea what they were talking about.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The "black girl" is my daughter. It's people like you that keep the race crap stirred up. You just look for ways to make things about race. These girls are her friends. You have no idea what you are talking about so you just need to shut up.</p>— Lyndarjan (@Lyndarjan1) <a href=#>May 26, 2018</a></figure><p>You'd figure that would be the end of the debate right there, that this woman's mother went on Twitter and pointed out that her daughter's friends aren't racist because, you know, she lives and interacts with these people on a daily basis. Apologies should be doled out, people should say sorry for jumping the gun, case closed.</p><p>But what if I told you that there are some people, who, despite being shown and told the contrary, will constantly try to confirm their own preconceived notions? Somehow, the conversation continued, and people began questioning the girl's mom about the nature of her daughter's friendships.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If they are her friends why they not holding her hands?</p>— IG: Summerofdresses (@PoLitaKaLLisa) <a href=#>May 27, 2018</a></figure><p>And the mom gave a response so personal that, if I heard it after asking such a question, I'd feel embarrassed.</p><p>As it turns out, she wasn't holding her friends' hands because she didn't want to start bawling in a stadium full of people. She did just suffer through a school shooting, you know.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>my daughter didn't want to cry before she had to sing and holding hands would have caused her to start crying that's the story nothing about race.</p>— Lyndarjan (@Lyndarjan1) <a href=#>May 27, 2018</a></figure><p>And just when you thought Twitter couldn't get any worse, someone actually asked her to prove that the little girl in the photo is actually her daughter.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Do you even have proof she’s your daughter?</p>— smh (@Paynereos) <a href=#>May 27, 2018</a></figure><p>So she obliged, not without a bit of sass, of course.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have a birth certificate which you will not be seeing.

Y'all are doing a damn good job.</p>— Lyndarjan (@Lyndarjan1) <a href=#>May 27, 2018</a></figure><p>Finally, her daughter came on Twitter herself to let those who were originally in an uproar over the photo were wrong.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love this girl to the moon and back. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/B6ZsTBosrs</a></p>— Lyndarjan (@Lyndarjan1) <a href=#>May 27, 2018</a></figure><p>There were some who pointed out that the original image was cropped and didn't include two other white students who weren't holding hands either.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dude look at her previous replies. THE PICTURE WAS CROPPED TO ATTRACT RACISM. THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE PIC NOT HOLDING HANDS. WHITE PEOPLE TO BE EXACT. The mother also explains why her daughter wasn't holding their hands. OH AND there's a video up now, FROM THE DAUGHTER.

Not everything has to be about race.... maybe she didn’t want to hold anyone’s hand... unless you were there don’t speak on the situation?
