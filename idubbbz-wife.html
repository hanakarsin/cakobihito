As of this writing, iDubbbz has not stated an official reason for Froggy's omission, and even Froggy Fresh himself claims to not know the reason.</p><p>In a follow-up tweet posted on April 2, Froggy Fresh posited two theories: It was either because of his friendship with controversial internet comedian Sam Hyde or because of his statements about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iDubbbz's wife</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is iDubbbz's wife? Get to know Anisa Jomha.</h2><p>iDubbbz is currently married to a woman named Anisa Jomha. On her Instagram, she describes herself as a video creator. She has previously been active on outlets like Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok, but posts sporadically on each of them if she posts at all. They got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married</a> in June 2021, with iDubbbz taking on her last name in their union.</p><p>On her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">protected Twitter</a>, she put "boxing promoter" in her profile, which would make her a perfect fit for iDubbbz Creator Clash event.</p><p>However, she has been recently named amid the ongoing controversy surrounding Creator Clash 2 and Froggy Fresh. While Froggy supposedly hasn't been told why he was removed from the roster, one of his theories was that it was because he openly stated that he would subscribe to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anisa's OnlyFans account</a>.</p><p>She previously started an OnlyFans account in 2020. Though iDubbbz has publicly stated that he's fine with it, he and Anisa were met with divisive reactions.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dear idubz <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HWGD2pIK2n</a></p>— Froggy Fresh (@iAmFroggyFresh) <a href=#>April 2, 2023</a></figure><p>Froggy Fresh continued to reference her OnlyFans in his Creator Clash 2 response, in which he challenges iDubbbz to an MMA-style cage match.</p><p>"If I win, iDubbbz and Creator Clash have to promise not to sue me for hanging out and training with Sam Hyde or for saying I would subscribe to Anisa's OnlyFans or whatever else they want to conjure up," Froggy stated. "But if iDubbbz wins, then I promise to never subscribe to Anisa's OnlyFans."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is iDubbbz's mother-in-law?</h2><p>Interestingly enough, Anisa's mother (i.e., iDubbbz's mother-in-law) was also roped into the controversy. Anisa's mom, Maureen Jomha, has actually worked closely with her daughter throughout her career on the internet. She previously worked as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">chat moderator</a> for Anisa's Twitch channel. Maureen was even active on Twitter as she interacted with other influencers.</p><p>With this kind of proximity to her daughter's career, it's no wonder that she's become part of the Creator Clash controversy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@bowblax href=#>@bowblax</a><p>iDubbbz Mother-in-law Wants Creator Clash Fighter FroggyFresh REPLACED <a title=idubbbz href=#>#idubbbz</a> <a title=creatorclash href=#>#creatorclash</a> <a title=creatorclash2 href=#>#creatorclash2</a> <a title=anisajomha href=#>#anisajomha</a> <a title=froggyfresh href=#>#froggyfresh</a> <a title=samhyde href=#>#samhyde</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Bowblax" href=#>♬ original sound - Bowblax</a></figure><p>Maureen and Froggy Fresh previously got into an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange</a> on Twitter, in which the two of them hurled insults at each other over Froggy Fresh not being in Creator Clash 2. In the days that would follow, Maureen would subsequently delete her Twitter account.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnrG2rsGbsWavmZuy</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kaduna-state.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Kaduna State On Naija News</span></a>
