I think he was even more excited than I was while I was pregnant. Say for instance, we have a disagreement and I go downstairs to the living room, he’d ask me to come back upstairs because he wants to speak to his baby in my belly. And then, he would lay his head on my stomach, and the baby would move and kick every single time Tunji&nbsp;did that,”</i> she said.</p><p>She also went on to highlight his support since she put to bed, stating that he stays up to feed the baby when she is trying to get some sleep.</p><p>[article_adwert]</p><p><i>“He changes diapers, makes his food and is very hands-on with the baby.”</i></p><p>When asked about her spiritual life she&nbsp;said she was&nbsp;‘very spiritual’.</p><p>The music star also talked about the fact that she pays her tithes often as well as her conversations with God.</p><p><i>“I am very spiritual. I do not joke with paying tithe or speaking with God. I may not always get to kneel down and pray but at some point in the car or wherever I am, I would have a conversation with God. I owe everything to him and I guess a lot of people don’t see that side,”</i> she said.</p><p>Tiwa explained that she ‘gave her life to God on July, 16 2002’ and went through a tough time following that. ­</p><p>She talked about the times she would get on a train and preach as well as practicing abstinence for three years.</p><p><i>“On July 16</i><i></i><i>&nbsp;</i><i>2002... I gave my life to God. I had gone through a tough time trying to find myself. I went through heartbreak, and I remember crying so much through that time. I felt lost and didn’t know where I needed to be in this world. I know this sounds cliché, but I was praying one day and I literally felt the presence of God in the room with me. And, you know when you first give your life to Christ, you are a radical. So, then, I would preach to strangers on the train and say “Jesus sent me to you”. Sometimes I would give my entire one month paycheck to the church; they asked for only 10%, but I would give the entire 100%. People scoffed and said “She is new in the faith, just give her another year”. And for three years, I was not intimate with a man. I didn’t kiss or have sex. Every time I hug a man it would be from the side. A lot of people can relate to that because it has happened to a lot of us but the key is to be consistent,” </i>she said.</p><p>The singer also stated that even if she wasn’t a Christian she still wouldn’t have lived a promiscuous life owing to her nature.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Privacy War: Tiwa Savage Fights Photographer</p><p>She said:<i>“Even if I was not a Christian, I was never that type of girl. I was a tomboy. My mum used to think I would be ga y. I am the only girl amongst 4 siblings so I used to wear trousers to feel like I was part of the boys. I never waxed my eyebrows and I hated high heels, which I still hate till today. I was never into boys which is probably why my husband has full confidence that the big men flashing money in my face won’t faze me.</i>”</p><p>Tiwa Savage is a multi award-winning singer and performer signed to Mavins Records.</p><p>The 35-year-old is famed for her genre-defining sounds and many hit songs, under the aegis of producer Don Jazzy, which have seen her maintain a dominant position in the Nigerian entertainment industry since she relocated to Nigeria.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3aAkm9qZqafqXqxvs6moKybpaTCtHnToq6aZaOWw6KzxGefraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bayashi-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bayashi - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
