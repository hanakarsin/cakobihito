Throughout the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye is the character we know the least about. He has impeccable aim and knows how to use his wide arsenal of arrows, but we know very little about his origin story."><meta name=author content="Enda Jantzen"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

He has impeccable aim and knows how to use his wide arsenal of arrows, but we know very little about his <a href=#>origin story</a>. Now, Clint is getting his own <a href=#>Disney Plus</a> series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawkeye</a>, before he passes the torch to Kate Bishop.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As we learn more about Clint, his past, and his arrows, details about how he can be a full-fledged human superhero are coming to light. It all comes down to the kinds of arrows Hawkeye uses. So here’s a breakdown of all the arrows we’ve seen him and Kate use so far, and some of the arrows from the comic books we’d love to see in <a href=#>Hawkeye</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Explosive Tip Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The best-known of Hawkeye’s trick arrows, the Explosive Tip arrow, explodes upon impact. Because its effects make for great action-packed cinema, Hawkeye has used it in every MCU movie he’s in. Plus, we see <a href=#>Kate Bishop</a> take advantage of this arrow in Episode 3 of Hawkeye before she remarks, "There's arrows more dangerous than that?"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Grappling Hook Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Another popular MCU arrow, the grappling arrow is Hawkeye’s claim to superherodom. Like Spider-Man, Hawkeye can latch onto any building or ledge and soar through the air using the grappling hook. He finally uses this arrow in Episode 3 of Hawkeye when he and Kate jump off the bridge to escape the Tracksuit Mafia.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Plunger Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In Hawkeye Episode 3, Kate uses this one to take down the Tracksuit Mafia in a car chase. The arrow suctions onto whatever it hits, much to Kate's chagrin when she uses it. "A plunger arrow?" Kate yells, "What is the trick? That it's completely useless?" In that case, yes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Smoke Bomb Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Hawkeye is the first time we see this crazy arrow in use. After Kate takes back her bow in the car chase on the bridge, she shoots off the Smoke Bomb arrow, which releases purple smoke throughout the Tracksuit Mafia's car. They veer off the road, no longer able to see.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Putty Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although Kate calls it a "Play-Doh Arrow," this arrow is really a putty arrow. When Kate shoots it at the Tracksuit Mafia's car, it emits a purple putty goo that inhibits the enemy. In this case, it takes over their windshield when the wipers attempt to wipe it off.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Octo Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This high-tech arrow releases multiple lines upon impact that latch onto objects around them. Kate uses it in Hawkeye quite effectively, when it latches onto the Tracksuit Mafia's car and covers them in Christmas trees. When she asks Clint what it's called, he jokes that it's a "Sorry, Santa."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pym Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Perhaps the most impressive of all the arrows, the Pym Arrow uses Pym technologies (yes, this is a direct reference to Hank Pym of Ant-Man). This arrow can be used to enlarge its target. In this case, Clint directs Kate to shoot a regular arrow upwards, and Clint shoots that arrow to enlarge it. This goes right into their target, obliterating their car.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">USB Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This arrow could be useful, and may even be very similar to the data arrow, but in Hawkeye, it's somewhat of a joke. After an intense car chase scene with many trick arrows, Kate pulls the USB arrow, which she knows will be useless in hurting their enemy, but is a great distraction! She rattles the Tracksuit Mafia a bit, but when she shoots it, it just bounces off its intended target.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Burst Shot Arrow</h2><p>Hawkeye uses this arrow in Avengers to take down a group of Chitauri soldiers. Basically, once it hits its target, it releases secondary projectiles, so it’s very useful for taking down an army.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hacker Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This arrow does not have a comic book counterpart, but it’s extremely useful. When Hawkeye aims it at any sort of data-driven device, it can hack the device and either steal its contents or give it a virus. He uses it when under Loki’s control in <a href=#>Avengers</a> to take down the Helicarrier, and uses it again in What If…? to download Zola’s A.I, which <a href=#>Black Widow then shoots into Ultron</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Acid Tip Arrow</h2><p>Some of Hawkeye’s arrows aren’t just for fighting. The Acid Arrow emits an acid that infiltrates any metal. It’s great for escapes and can be seen in both Avengers, as well as in Hawkeye. Kate uses it to take down traffic lights and create obstacles during the car chase with the Tracksuit Mafia.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Thermal Incendiary Arrow</h2><p>Hawkeye uses this arrow to take down a Chitauri Chariot in Avengers. It can make its way through any metal, creating a heat reaction before exploding, so it’s another great one for visual excitement.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Electro-Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This arrow is first seen in Avengers: Age of Ultron. When <a href=#>Wanda Maximoff</a> is still an enemy, Hawkeye shoots the Electro-Arrow at her brain to debilitate her and her powers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Trap Arrow</h2><p>The Trap Arrow operates slightly differently from the rest of the arrows in Hawkeye’s arsenal. Hawkeye shoots two of these, creating an electric field between them that will trap and electrocute any being who tries to walk between them. He uses this to trap Vision when rescuing Wanda in Captain America: Civil War.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Scatter Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Hawkeye uses this arrow during Captain America: Civil War when <a href=#>Ant-Man</a> rides the arrow to get to Iron Man. The arrow separates into many smaller fragmented arrows to distract its target.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Flare Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When Hawkeye gets trapped behind the New Avengers Facility, he uses the flare arrow to send up a signal, as well as to see his surroundings.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Net Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We may finally get to see this arrow in live action in Hawkeye, but in What If…?, Hawkeye uses the net arrow to subdue the Ultron Sentries. It basically casts a net onto the target and holds the target in place.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Force Field Arrow</h2><p>Hawkeye also uses this arrow in <a href=#>What If…?</a> to protect himself and Natasha from the Ultron sentries when they’re discovered. It works for a bit, but is more of a defensive arrow than an offensive one.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Boomerang Arrow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In the comic books, Clint uses this arrow plenty, but we haven’t seen it much in the MCU. It is basically just an arrow that returns to its owner, and while that doesn’t sound as interesting as some other arrows, seeing it whiz back and forth on the screen could be very exciting.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">BONUS: Tennis Ball Arrow</h2><p>There’s no official name for this one, but this is Kate's arrow that she fires in the first episode of Hawkeye toward the clock tower. The tennis ball balances the weight of the arrow as the back latches onto a rope... and then the entire clock tower collapses. (Marvel loves a big collapse.)</p><p>New episodes of Hawkeye drop every Wednesday on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIykoKecXaSzbq3Rq6awq12ZvKa%2FjKGYsKOVrrJutMCvnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chicken-fried-paper-fingers.html><span>←</span><span>Viral TikTok Video Exposes Deep-Fried Paper Being Served as Chicken Fingers</span></a>
