Most of the people have been incredibly warm, they are praying for me, saying 'Come back strong, hang in there.' Others are offering all types of cure, they say 'Drink a lot of lemon water, ginger and garlic, take vitamin C, seat in the sun for like 20 minutes,"' he said.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Papa Shirandula actor Njoro shows off handsome, grown sons in lovely photo</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Tanasha's replacement?
