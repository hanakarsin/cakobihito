His goal as an intimacy coach on the show is to help the contestants connect with each other without hooking up.

Although he isn't on the show the entire time in any given season, he is instrumental in helping the contestants discover things about themselves. That's because he does this for a living when the cameras aren't around too.</p><p>And it all started because he happened to travel to Southeast Asia after he took a break from playing professional baseball. There, Brenden met with a monk who taught him about Tantra.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brenden Durell (@brendendurell)</a></p></figure><p>"Through this unexpected experience, I learned a lot about myself, which eventually led me to teach people skills on how to learn more about themselves," Brenden shared with us. "As a result, they developed deeper connections both romantically and platonically in their lives."</p><p>Brenden didn't have any aspirations to be on <a href=#>reality TV</a>. But when Netflix "slid into [his] DMs" and then his email inbox, Brenden was intrigued enough to see what producers had to say.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Kenzie Rich Photography</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Brenden hosts his own retreat called Rewilding the Man.</h2><p>Brenden's retreat is quite different from the one we see on Too Hot to Handle, but it's important for its participants all the same. Brenden shared with us that the experience is "specifically for men who seek adventure, brotherhood and a full on life changing experience by being immersed in untouched-off the grid nature."</p><p>Brenden takes both men and women on retreats in the Amazon Rainforest throughout the year as well. But this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rewilding the Man</a> is a different kind of adventure for the men who sign up for it.</p><p>"It's a week of training from myself and my good friend on how to be and live as a purpose-driven man," Brenden explained. "A couple of the contestants from Too Hot To Handle will most likely come [to my 2023 retreat in October], which will be epic."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brenden Durell (@brendendurell)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Brenden Durell shared thoughts on the success rate of reality TV dating shows.</h2><p>To Brenden, if couples can form under the intense pressure of cameras and being on reality television and last beyond that, they have the potential to go far.</p><p>"In my view, dating show relationships that withstand the test of time have the potential to be something amazing because starting a relationship in front of an audience is challenging," he said.</p><p>In other words, don't totally count out those showmances you see on reality television.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BmusOepWacpaeyrbiMraaoZZikwW7AzmafmqaUobI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./man-who-exposed-visa-methods-used-by-nigerians-to-escape-poverty-to-uk-authorities-attacked.html><span>←</span><span>Man Who Exposed Visa Methods Used By Nigerians To Escape Poverty To UK Authorities Attacked</span></a>
