This new chapter will bring endless joy and shared adventures for our whole family!‚Äù</p><p>What's more, Jed mentioned that their twin girls "will be the first twin grandbabies in the Duggar family."</p><p>Although we can't confirm her due date, Katey appears to be in the early stages of her pregnancy as of this writing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jedidiah ü§ç Katey Duggar (@jed_duggar)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Katey Duggar's announced she was pregnant with her second child, Nora Kate Duggar, in December 2022.</h2><p>On Dec. 17, 2022, Jed and Katey <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">published a pregnancy announcement</a>, titled "We've Been Keeping a Secret," to their YouTube channel.</p><p>In it, they shared footage of themselves revealing the pregnancy to their subscribers ‚Äî they also shared how they announced the news to the larger Duggar family. Katey and Jed decided to do their pregnancy reveal at the ugly Christmas sweater/Christmas character party that Michelle and Jim Bob host each year at the "big house."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube/Jed & Katey Duggar</span></figure><p>For the party, Katey opted to wear a sweatshirt that read "Joy to the world" in large lettering, and then "Oh, & I'm pregnant" in smaller lettering underneath. The couple basically approached each member of the Duggar family separately as they arrived at the party and asked if they liked Katey's shirt. Cue the: "OMG, seriously?!" reactions.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>As Jed and Katey shared, it was in September 2022, when the family was on their Florida beach trip, that Katey got her first positive pregnancy test. (So they successfully kept the news to themselves for three months.)</p><p>In the video, Katey disclosed to her sister-in-law, Abbie (John David's wife) that she's due a day after Joy-Anna Duggar is due. Joy-Anna previously shared that she's due with baby No. 3 on May 23, 2023 ‚Äî so that would put Katey's due date at May 24, 2023. However, it appears Katey gave birth to Nora Kate Duggar on or around June 2, 2023, according to a sweet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> welcoming her to the world.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jedidiah ü§ç Katey Duggar (@jed_duggar)</a></p></figure><p>Jed and Katey had also shared their pregnancy news via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>.
