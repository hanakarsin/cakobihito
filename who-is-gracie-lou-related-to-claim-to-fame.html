But that's not necessarily the case for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gracie Lou</a> and the other contestants competing for $100,000 on <a href=#>Claim to Fame</a>. But who is Gracie Lou related to, and is that even her real name? Apparently, there's a lot about her that she hoped would deter the other players from figuring out who she is related to.</p><p>Each season, a new cast of relatives have to figure out who the others are related to without any help from outside sources or social media. And viewers at home are in the same boat, except for the fact that if you're great at internet sleuthing, you might be able to figure it out first. After Gracie Lou was sent home in the July 17 episode, all was revealed about who she is related to, and she spoke exclusively with Distractify about her experience.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Gracie Lou's celebrity relative on 'Claim to Fame' is Jon Cryer!</h2><p>In the Season 3 premiere of Claim to Fame, Gracie Lou shares some details about who she is related to in the form of some pertinent clues. And one of those clues is that the country girl persona she is playing at is far from the truth when it comes to who her famous relative actually is. When she incorrectly guesses who Adam's relative is in Episode 2, she's sent packing.</p><p>It is then revealed that Gracie Lou's famous relative is Jon Cryer. While you might know the actor from Two And a Half Men, he's also known for Pretty in Pink, among other things. And though it was Naomi's relative whose wine bottle clue says something about the "brat pack," and not Gracie Lou's, that guess was the right one among lots of wild theories fans had before Gracie Lou's elimination.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Chris Willard</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Gracie Lou spoke exclusively with 'Distractify' about her experience on 'Claim to Fame.'</h2><p>After Gracie Lou faced her early elimination on Claim to Fame, we caught up with her to hear about her experience on the show and what advice her famous uncle gave her, going into the competition. Read on for our Q&A with Gracie Lou!</p><p>(Editor's note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.)</p><p><strong>Q: You came into the house with a solid plan of fooling everyone with your relative, down to your name and background change. How far did you suspect that to take you?</strong></p><p>A: I expected it to take me pretty far actually. I knew there would be a point where more about my relative would be revealed, but I still believed most of my fellow contestants would be led astray and keep looking elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Q: One thing you didn't lie about was your own musical talent, though. Tell us more about your band!</strong></p><p>A: Last year I started to perform my originals in various venues around NYC, and for some side hustles I sing in a touring female artist tribute band, a vocal jazz trio, and as a backup vocalist for a few artists! A goal of mine is to record an EP this year!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Chris Willard</span></figure><p><strong>Q: What went through your mind when you realized Naomi totally tricked you with that guess about Adam's relative?</strong></p><p>A: I truly thought that we both had no clue about him or anyone else, so when I found out, I was mostly just disappointed that we were both wrong.</p><p><strong>Q: We see you say in a confessional about Naomi, something like, "I can trust Naomi. Together, we can run the house." How close were you leading up to your elimination?</strong></p><p>A: Naomi and I had our moments, but in the end, I believed we could get far in the house together. After my failed attempt at trying to get her to work with me, we had a rough couple of hours but made up shortly after with some de-puff eye masks.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Chris Willard</span></figure><p><strong>Q: Who have you kept in touch with from </strong><strong>Claim to Fame</strong><strong> since filming ended?</strong></p><p>A: Pretty much everyone! There is a group chat we all keep in touch through. Adam and I call and check in, Naomi and I send TikToks to each other, and I’ve hung out with Danny and his family!</p><p><strong>Q: What kind of advice did your uncle give you, going into the competition?</strong></p><p>A: He said, “Trust no one!” He also knows that I can be too nice sometimes, and challenged me to get out of my comfort zone to really play the game.</p><p><strong>Q: We see him appear in your car at the end of the episode to escort you home. What did you think when he rolled up in that "Duckman" car?</strong></p><p>A: It was such a silly yet heartwarming moment. It really comforted me getting to leave the house with him, and I will cherish the honor it was getting to share the screen with him for a brief moment!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney/Chris Willard</span></figure><p><strong>Q: Without giving anything away, who could you see going far in the competition on </strong><strong>Claim to Fame</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p>A: I can see Danny going far. No one seems to have him figured out in the slightest, and he is such a fun fixture of the house. Danny also seems to have so much knowledge on this kind of thing, so if he can whittle it down, I think he has a strong chance!</p><p>Claim to Fame airs on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on ABC.
