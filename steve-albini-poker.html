His cause of death was reported as a heart attack.</p><p>While most casual music fans might know of him as the guy who produced <a href=#>Nirvana</a>’s In Utero and the best records from the Pixies, PJ Harvey, and other influential rock artists, some hardcore gamblers might have known him as a peer.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Steve Albini performing in 2016</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Steve Albini was an award-winning poker player.</h2><p>While he’ll be remembered for being behind the board for iconic albums and his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrical Audio</a> studio, he might not have been able to make some of those records and pay some of those studio bills without his <a href=#>poker winnings</a>.</p><p>In a 2018 piece in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ringer</a> published after Steve won his first World Series of Poker bracelet, he explained how the game is different than his day job: “I feel like the parts of my brain that I’m not using in my day-to-day life come into play. I don’t do a lot of calculating when I’m going through a normal day. You’re doing at least some sort of rudimentary math in every hand of poker. When you’re playing cards you have to do a lot of sort of prediction of behavior."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Steve Albini in Electrical Audio in 2005</p></figure><p>Steve won his second bracelet in June 2022. “Everything in my life comes in pieces, in parts. Poker is one part of my life," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WSOP.com</a> after his six-digit prize. "When I'm playing poker, I try to commit to it. I try to take it seriously. I try to make sure I devote the attention to it that it deserves as an occupation. But it's only part of my year. I only play tournaments at the World Series of Poker. I play cash games informally in Chicago. It's a part of my livelihood, but it's not my profession.”</p><p>You can see Steve’s elation in a video WSOP also released after Steve won $196,089. Steve won a total of $370,045 in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">World Series of Poker tournaments</a> in his lifetime. Obviously there’s no total of all of his total wins in house games.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">If you’re interested in Steve Albini’s poker tips, he shared some in a Reddit AMA.</h2><p>Twelve years ago Steve did an extensive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit AMA</a>. When asked about what forums and books he’d recommend for an inexperienced player, he gave a very useful response. "The forums at twoplustwo.com are fantastic resources with some of the best minds in the game sharing a lot of information. I also like the more detailed content at Cardrunners.com and Nutblocker.com."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Steve Albini performing in 2022</p></figure><p>His book response was just as helpful. “I'd stick with stuff on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2+2 imprint</a> to start, especially their game-specific 'for advanced players' books, all golden. For Holdem I like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Harrington's</a> tournament books and the new <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Little</a> books, but I don't play either Holdem or tournaments that much, and there are better people to ask than me. I like Bill Chen's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mathematics of Poker</a> and David Sklansky's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Theory of Poker</a> because they teah general concepts that you can adapt to different games and disciplines."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGmwsRmmKWamaO2brzOpJyr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./liverpool-shut-training-ground-as-covid-19-cases-surges.html><span>←</span><span>Liverpool Shut Training Ground As COVID-19 Cases Surges</span></a>
