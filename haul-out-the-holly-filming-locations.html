It’s my favorite time of year, and it really makes sense that I have found my way to into making all of these movies because it is something in real life I just love so much.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lacey Chabert endured sweltering filming locations for ‘Haul Out the Holly.’</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fred Hayes/Hallmark Media</span><p>Wes Brown and Lacey Chabert in 'Haul Out the Holly'</p></figure><p style=text-align:start>If Lacey looks chilly in Haul Out the Holly as the movie airs on Saturday, Nov. 26, at 8 p.m. ET on the Hallmark Channel, well, that’s just a testament to her acting skills. She and the rest of the cast and crew filmed the movie in Utah “in the middle of summer in the middle of a heatwave.”</p><p>Still, the costume department had their mandate to make it look Christmassy.</p><p style=text-align:start>“You’re bundled up in wool and cashmere and scarves and coats, and it’s 107 degrees outside,” Lacey said. “That’s how you know you’re making a Christmas movie: It’s hot, and you’re trying not to faint. … And trying to act cold, because when you’re cold, your body language is totally different. You’re not fanning yourself, you know?”</p><p style=text-align:start>Even so, Lacey said she had “so much fun” filming the movie. She pointed out a scene of her character greeting Melissa Peterman’s character at the door to her house. “It’s over 100 degrees that day,” Lacey says. “I was the lucky one, though, because I was standing inside the house.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In the movie, Lacey plays a woman home alone for the holidays.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p style=text-align:start>Haul Out the Holly has the <a href=#>Mean Girls alum</a> playing Emily, a woman who has to step up her holiday-decorating game. “Emily arrives home, hoping to visit her parents, only to discover that they are leaving on a trip of their own,” Hallmark teases in a synopsis. “As she stays at their house for the holidays, their [homeowner association] is determined to get Emily to participate in the neighborhood’s many Christmas festivities.”</p><p style=text-align:start>In the trailer for the movie, Emily gets a violation for “insufficient Christmas decor” from a neighbor played by Wes Brown. “Your nutcracker needs to be 36 inches from shoe to chapeau,” he says, breaking out the tape measure.</p><p style=text-align:start>And in her GMA interview, Lacey summed up the appeal of holiday Hallmark movies like hers. “You know, I think people, myself included, just want to feel happy and hopeful and, you know, to sit down in front of your TV and know for a couple of hours that you and your family are going to be entertained and left feeling good, so it’s something that I really now consider myself very fortunate to be a part of.”</p><p>Haul Out the Holly premieres on Saturday, Nov. 26 at 8 p.m. ET on the Hallmark Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna62uIyorK1lpJ2ybrTOpaOyZZaeua61zaBkpaeTlsGqu82s</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carson-peters-html.html><span>←</span><span>Carson Peters - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
