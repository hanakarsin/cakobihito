Let's be real ‚Äî the show thrives in the confusion and speculation that it causes, and those same feelings drive millions of eager viewers back to their screens each week to see what's next.</p><p>For Season 7 of The Masked Singer, that fan-favorite formula is being applied once again to another set of celebrities hidden behind outrageous costumes. One such costume that's been catching a lot of viewer attention is Hydra, the three-headed dragon that's roaring its way onto the Masked Singer scene. So, who is Hydra on The Masked Singer? The men behind the costume were revealed on Wednesday, April 6.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hydra on 'The Masked Singer' ‚Äî The Clues</h2><p>We weren't given a ton of information about Hydra's true identity, but here are some of the clues we were shown for the green-and-purple three-headed Dragon:</p><ul><li>A magic 8-ball that said "Ask your amigos"</li><li>A picture of a shark</li><li>Miami</li><li>A beach ball with a bull on it</li></ul><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hydra on 'The Masked Singer' ‚Äî The Guesses</h2><p>Like previous characters that have appeared on the show, such as the <a href=#>Russian Dolls</a>, judge Ken Jeong believed that Hydra was actually a collection of three people. Given that Hydra was a three-headed beast, his guess was that longtime pals Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, and Martin Short were behind the mask.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Ken believed this to be the case because:</p><ul><li>He has been "dying" to have Martin Short on the show.</li><li>The magic 8-ball read "Ask your amigos." (Chevy, Steve, and Martin famously starred together in The Three Amigos.)</li><li>He knows Chevy's from working with him on Community, and knows that one of his iconic SNL characters was the Land Shark.</li></ul><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Here are some other potential guesses for who could be behind the Hydra mask:</p><ul><li>Migos</li><li>Joe Hawley, Rob Cantor, and Andrew Horowitz</li><li>Colin Mochrie, Ryan Stiles, and Greg Proops</li><li>The Jonas Brothers</li><li>Members of Green Day</li><li>Members of Boyz II Men</li></ul><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is Hydra on 'The Masked Singer'?

The three-headed dragon certainly threw people off... until we saw that the third head was occupied by a stuffed rabbit in a hat!</p><p>While many viewers were surprised to see the legendary magicians and comedians, some Reddit users have thought it could be them for a while.</p><p>"As a big Penn and Teller fan ‚Äî that sounds a LOT like Penn. I don‚Äôt think Teller would EVER do a show like this, but I could be wrong," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one user wrote</a>. "I could see Penn more likely to do it with a friend like Piff the Magic Dragon ‚Äî but you wouldn‚Äôt have Penn with someone else other than Teller ‚Äî so maybe it is just Penn and Teller. I don‚Äôt know Teller's voice well enough to know for sure, but I‚Äôd bet he is actually able to sing OK."</p><p>Did you guess that Hydra was Penn and Teller?
