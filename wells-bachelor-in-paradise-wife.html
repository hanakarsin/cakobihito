Reality TV veteran Wells Adams made his primetime debut during the premiere of Joelle &#34;JoJo&#34; Fletcher’s season of The Bachelorette in 2016 and was ultimately sent home in Week 6. But he hadn’t given up on finding love that fast. Later that year, Wells tried his luck on Season 3 of Bachelor in Paradise, and though his romance with Ashley Iaconetti looked promising, their relationship soon fizzled, and Wells was sent packing yet again."><meta name=author content="Hettie Henneman"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
