This he did on Tuesday when he visited the state.</p><p>The Rivers State Governor shunned PDP’s gubernatorial candidate in Lagos, <strong>Olajide Adeniran</strong>, also known as Jandor, saying that contesting against the incumbent governor of the state is nothing but a waste of time.</p><p>According to him, the Lagos Governor had raised the standard of governance with the quality of projects delivered across Lagos.</p><p>Reacting, to Wike’s claims, PDP in a statement issued on Tuesday evening by its Publicity Secretary in Lagos, <strong>Hakeem Amode,</strong> said the Rivers State Governor’s rant didn’t come as a surprise.</p><p>The party leadership said it would have been disappointed if Wike had attended any event “without his usual rant of a drowning man who will clutch at straw.”</p><p>The statement read: “I only wonder how Governor Wike, who didn’t support Jandor and at the same time couldn’t stop him from picking the party ticket in Lagos, despite his supposed might within the PDP, would apportion to himself the decision of generality of Lagosians in the forthcoming election.</p><p>“While we won’t but acknowledge Governor Wike’s developmental strides in Rivers State which have witnessed an influx of other state chief executives including Sanwo-Olu for commissioning, it is worrisome that Wike will call Sanwo-Olu a performer without asking how many times he has invited anyone to Lagos for the commissioning of an ordinary borehole in his almost four years in office as Governor.”</p><h2>You And Sanwo-Olu Will Be Ex-Governors Next Year</h2><p>Confident of winning the gubernatorial election in Lagos State, Amode said Jandor will defeat Sanwo-Olu in the forthcoming election, and render the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate jobless after the polls.</p><p>The opposition party said: “My dear Governor and leader, we promise to render Sanwo-Olu jobless and send him to the club of you former Governors next year. Only God, who has seen Jandor and Lagos PDP this far, and the generality of Lagosians, can determine his fate at the polls in 2023, not your endorsement.</p><p>“We will continue to sell our breath of fresh air agenda to Lagosians with the promise of a better tomorrow. Lagos needs a breath of fresh air.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BxZmtoYmh6urvUq2SrmZ6ptq%2BzjJ2gnaakYrCwucRmmKxlkWLAtr7Pq6CsnV2hrqi70mannahdqLmiudJmrqKjlWKzsL6MnqWdp6Kotq%2BzjKyYp6%2BfYrytwY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jasmeet-singh-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jasmeet Singh - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
