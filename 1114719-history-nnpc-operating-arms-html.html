It saw its creation in 1977, April 1 to be precise. It was created from merging the Nigerian National Oil Corporation, or NNOC, with the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel. By decree №33, it acquired the liabilities and assets of the NNOC and took on the responsibility for some of the Ministry’s functions.</p><p class=align-left>Why did the merger happen? For that, it is important to give you a few words about the NNOC. It was created in 1971 after Nigeria decided to join the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. As you can see, it lasted for only six years before being turned into NNPC. The reason for that is its operating failures that led to the Crude Oil Sales Tribunal of the 1980s.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/05f3bdc177de1d51.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mafab, MTN set to rollout 5G in August as FG list out first six states to enjoy the technology in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As the investigation for the tribunal showed, NNOC was incapable of finding buyers for its product, which is why it failed to collect 183 million barrels of its share of oil (that could have produced over $2 billion in revenues). However, it paid the full price of operating costs. By merging with the Ministry and changing its name, NNOC, which now became NNPC, hoped to improve the situation.</p><p class=align-left>Decentralization of NNPC</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/05f3bdc177de1d51.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Effect of corruption in Nigeria</p><p class=align-left>What is also interesting, is that, before the Tribunal, NNOC haven’t conducted any audit of its accounts starting from 1975, even when it became a completely different company. The Tribunal, however, forced the now NNPC to provide yearly audit reports.</p><p class=align-left>Additionally, the Tribunal also called for decentralization of NNPC through a series of reforms. The first wave of reforms resulted in the creation of nine subsidiaries in 1981. In the year 1988, NNPC had 12 business units, which covered the whole of the oil industry and its operations. This included commercial investments, distribution, engineering, exploration and production, gas development, petrochemicals and refining.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4b091ac442ae8632.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>SIM/NIN Linkage: Terrorists, bandits' major plight in northeast revealed</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Apart from conducting exploration, NNPC earned more power. It could now have a stake in operational interests of refining, product transportation, petrochemicals and marketing. From 1978 and until 1989, NNPC was building its refineries in Kaduna, Port Harcourt and Warri. It also took over the Shell refinery in Port Harcourt. The refinery was established in 1965 and produced 35 thousand barrels of product.</p><p class=align-left>Issues after 1990</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt76q457k9v52.jpeg><p class=align-left>As the 1990s rolled in, Nigeria, as well as NNPC, had to deal with border disputes, civil unrest, corruption, political instability and subpar governance. Despite these issues, foreign oil companies still considered Nigeria to be a highly profitable business opportunity. They put investment into oil exploration upstream. Most pleasant regions for that were the deltas and basins of Western Africa: Niger Delta, Benin Basin, the Benue Trough, Chad Basin, and Anambra Basin.</p><p class=align-left>The 2000s were both good and bad for the company. In 2003, Nigerian government started deregulating fuel prices and calls for privatization of four main oil refineries. At the same time, NNPC had to let go of more than two thousand of its employees until 2005. However, in 2005, NNPC signed a major $1 billion contract. Chevron Texaco Nigeria gave this money for construction of an FPSO or Floating, Production, Storage, and Offloading Vessel. After that, things started to look up.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/bf50520dd530e915.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigeria to use borrowed fund for subsidy payment as Russia-Ukraine war stretches Buhari’s govt finances</span></p></a><p class=align-left>By law, NNPC manages the venture between several multinational corporations and the Nigerian government. These corporations include Agip, Chevron Texaco, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Thanks to this collaboration, Nigeria is able to conduct exploration and production of petroleum.</p><p class=align-left>NNPC is located in Herbert Macaulay Way, Central Business District of Abuja in a four-tower complex called NNPC Towers. It also has offices in other Nigerian cities like Kaduna, Lagos, Warri and Port Harcourt, as well as in London.</p><p class=align-left>NNPC subsidiaries</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4b091ac442ae8632.jpeg><p class=align-left>As we have said before, NNPC was decentralized, after which it was divided into several smaller companies.

DPR makes sure the companies comply with the industry regulations, works with applications for leases, permits and licenses, creates and imposes environmental regulations.
