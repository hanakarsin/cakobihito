So let's just say an animal-whispering RDJ is going to be a real treat.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">RDJ isn't the only big star in the remake.&nbsp;</h2><p>It turns out Tom Holland will also play an important role in the film, according to PopSugar. So, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who will Tom Holland play in Dolittle</a>? Here's a hint: his already sky-high cuteness level is about to skyrocket.</p><p>Like Maleficent, Alice and Wonderland, or The Jungle Book, Dolittle looks like it's going to be a slightly darker version of the original version of the film.&nbsp;Definitely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">watch the trailer</a> below, if you haven't already.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Cute, right? It looks slightly more action-packed than the 1998 and 1967 versions, while simultaneously maintaining that essential made-for-family quality.</p><p>Anyway, you definitely didn't see the&nbsp;23-year-old English actor in the trailer, and that's because he won't physically appear in the film. That's right &nbsp;— our boy Tom is showing off his wild side and playing an animal. And his animal role is actually one of the most important non-human roles in the film.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who (or what) does Tom Holland play in Dolittle?&nbsp;</h2><p>In the new Dolittle movie, Tom will be playing Dolittle's sidekick, Jip. Jip is Dolittle's dog — who in the 1967 version was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a golden retriever with an unbelievable sense of smell</a>, according to the movie's Wikipedia page. Now, Jip is going to appear as a scruffy grey mutt, voiced by the great Tom Holland.</p><p>Take a look at how cute he is in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the trailer for the 2020 remake</a>... you seriously won't be able to handle it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>OK, don't get me wrong — <a href=#>Tom played a stellar Peter Parker</a>. But Tom as a scruffy grey dog sidekick is probably the cutest role he will ever play.</p><p>Oh, and adding to the cuteness, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jip is a dog who wears glasses</a>. Take a look at the movie poster, which features Jip sporting the circular spectacles, below. But, beware — your heart might actually melt.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He’s just not a people person. <a href=#>#DolittleMovie</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NXJxOytqyH</a></p>— Dolittle (@DolittleMovie) <a href=#>October 12, 2019</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Aside from Tom looking seriously adorable, the plot also looks pretty enticing.</h2><p>Like I said, it seems like Dolittle is going to be far more action-packed than its predecessors.&nbsp;While it's still based on the 1920 children's book, according to Entertainment Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the movie picks up seven years after the doctor's wife has passed</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Since her death, Dolittle has isolated himself in his impressive estate, with the comfort of his exotic animal friends.</p><p>However, when the young queen (played by Jessie Buckley) gets sick, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dolittle is commissioned to find a cure</a>, according to Entertainment Weekly.</p><p>He sets sail on his ship, meets new animal friends, and is essentially thrust out of his shell. And based on the trailer, it seems like it won't only be compelling, but it will also be visually stunning, to say the least.&nbsp;</p><p>While RDJ is going to slay the new Dolittle flick, I'm probably the most excited to see Tom as a dog wearing glasses. There is seriously nothing cuter than that, and honestly, I wouldn't have picked anyone else for the role.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbyueceoo6WZnpl6pbvLoqutpJU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fisayo-soyombo.html><span>←</span><span>Read All The Latest News About Fisayo Soyombo On Naija News</span></a>
