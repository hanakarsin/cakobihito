Badagry, a coastal town by the Lagoon, was established in 15th Century. The name Badagry was said to have been evolved from the dual corruption of Agbedegreme (which means Agbedeh’s farm in “Ogu” language) to Agbedagari and Agbedagari to Badagry by Yoruba settlers and European slave traders respectively.

But before the slave trade era, it was a place of subsistence farming and fishing, due to its proximity to the ocean.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7lvlc3un4pq.jpeg><p>3.
