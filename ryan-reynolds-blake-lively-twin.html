Source: GettyThere's no doubt Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively have the perfect relationship. They manage to be loving parents, successful actors, and still find time for their marriage. How do they fit it all in? By confining their squabbles to social media.
The two are always teasing each other on Instagram and Twitter, to fans delight. Probably also to the delight of their enemies, if they take even half of these public spats seriously."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

They manage to be loving parents, successful actors, and still find time for their marriage. How do they fit it all in? By confining their squabbles to social media.</p><p>The two are always teasing each other on Instagram and Twitter, to fans delight. Probably also to the delight of their enemies, if they take even half of these public spats seriously. Whether it's saying they <a href=#>need time alone</a>, or implying <a href=#>infidelity</a>, these two seem to always be on the same wavelength.</p><p>They're also great at drawing attention to advertising opportunities. Ryan Reynolds has bought into a product called Aviation Gin, and to promote it, he sat down with his "twin" Gordon, for an interview. Obviously, Gordon is played by Reynolds.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Today is #NationalBestFriendsDay.

Your brother is hot. I’ve made a terrible mistake…” Lively wrote.</p><p>Reynolds responded, “You haven’t made a mistake. You’ve been living with him for over a year.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Secret brother and secret lover. Surprise, Blake Lively.</p><p>This is the second time in recent weeks that the two have playfully sparred online, while also conveniently bringing attention to a promotional opportunity. In late May, Lively shared a trailer for her new movie, A Simple Favor, and Reynolds commented on it, saying Lively could spoil the movie for him, essentially:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You can tell me. We’re married. You once drove me to the hospital when you were giving birth. So... what the fuck happened to Emily? <a href=#>https://t.co/W5vWQI9TVr</a></p>— Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) <a href=#>May 26, 2018</a></figure><p>She responded by suggesting she actually has a whole horde of secrets he doesn't even want to know.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oh darling, of all the secrets I’m keeping from you, this should be the LEAST of your concerns... trust me.</p>— Blake Lively (@blakelively) <a href=#>May 26, 2018</a></figure><p>I may go see A Simple Favor while drunk on Aviation Gin, and then cry during the credits because I don't have a marriage like Lively and Reynolds. That's what guerilla advertising does to people.</p><p>Their adorable antics aren't selling everyone, according to the comments:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Hmm, excellent point. But for many others, these two are still the definition of "couple goals."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>But my favorite comment is probably from this person who rightly points out that Lively would be lucky to have two Ryan Reynolds. One for the morning, and one for the night.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Though if Blake Lively had two husbands, she'd have no time on her hands to do anything but roast them both, all day long:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This kills me... 😂😂😂😂😂 <a href=#>#thesecommentsmademyday</a> <a href=#>#megadiezwei</a> <a href=#>#kannnichtmehr</a> <a href=#>#blakelively</a> <a href=#>#ryanreynolds</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/iG4sBiXCKa</a></p>— mavisa (@mvgemini) <a href=#>February 15, 2018</a></figure><p>And she'd be dealing with twice as much of this:</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy Birthday to my amazing wife. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7vulMXqOdp</a></p>— Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) <a href=#>August 26, 2017</a></figure><p>But it seems to keep them happy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZpbl9mfnB9pm%2BLp5lfp8aiuoyrnLKmn6GxtHnBpZiknV2htrexy7Jkra%2BZow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-police-arrest-3-bandits-responsible-for-the-kidnap-of-bethel-baptist-school-students-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Police Arrest 3 Bandits Responsible For The Kidnap Of Bethel Baptist School Students (Photo)</span></a>
