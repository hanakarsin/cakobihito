TikTok is arguably the biggest social media platform to explode in 2019. Some of the most viral moments of the entire year originated on the video platform. But the most-liked video on TikTok doesn't necessarily mean the most viewed overall. Many of these videos started out on TikTok but became so popular that they transcended the app, ending up on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube."><meta name=author content="Chauncey Koziol"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Some of the most viral moments of the entire year originated on the video platform. But the most-liked video on <a href=#>TikTok</a> doesn't necessarily mean the most viewed overall. Many of these videos started out on TikTok but became so popular that they transcended the app, ending up on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube. Without further ado...</p><h2>Enjoy the most liked videos on TikTok:</h2><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">1. Record-breaking experiment</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>There's no doubt that <a href=#>David Dobrik </a>knows what he's doing when it comes to the internet, so it's only natural that he would have one of the most viewed TikToks of the year. This is like a giant version of the Mentos and Diet Coke experiment, and I love it.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">2. Dancing ferret</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>I'm probably responsible for five million of the 10 million views this video has. It's just a ferret dancing with a tiny Pikachu, but it brings me such joy. TikTok is heaven for funny animal videos.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">3. Origin story</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Speaking of adorable animal videos, this is perfect. The dogs are adorable on their own, but it's really the narration that tips it over the edge. Make sure to watch with sound.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">4. Banana birth</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Doing surgery on fruit has become a weird corner of the viral internet, but even if you think it's weird, you have to admit that this video of a banana giving birth to a baby banana is extremely cute. I don't make the rules! I just follow them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">5. Home greeting</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Again, this is a must-watch with sound. You would think that a guy coming home from work and being greeted by a llama (SPOILER!) would be the best part of this, but no. It's this dude's weird, ad-libbed, a cappella version of Vanessa Carlton's "A Thousand Miles." Who would have thunk it?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">6. Crying girl dance</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>This video, of this poor girl halfheartedly dancing while she cries, became one of the biggest memes of the year. If you haven't seen it yet, I can't help you. It was everywhere. I think it exploded in popularity because of how relatable it is. We all know what it's like to go through the motions even though you're having a terrible day. This is the greatest distillation of that feeling.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">7. "Mr. Sandman" cat dance</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>This is not only one of the greatest TikToks ever made, but I would venture to say it is one of the best videos ever made. Period. This required some real skill and patience, not to mention one cute cat. I could watch this on a loop forever.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">8. Kombucha girl</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Much like the crying dance girl, Kombucha Girl transcended the limits of TikTok and became one of the biggest and best memes of the year. <a href=#>Brittany Broski</a> is a national treasure. Seriously, this girl needs to be a big star.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">9. Wholesome hummingbird</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Wholesome animal content is what a lot of us come to the internet for, and TikTok is no exception. Take a look at this wholesome video of a guy helping a hummingbird get some nectar. This is the kind of video we need right now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">10. Shaving cream Croc</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>If you're a fan of pimple-popping videos or earwax removal videos, this simple clip of a person filling a Croc with shaving cream and then sticking a foot in that Croc was made for you. The music fits perfectly, and that satisfying burst at the end simply can't be beat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmasmJp6rrvSrWSloZuasW7CyJ2cqGWfo3q1tcqtpqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./338963-sonko-abadili-siasa-zake-sasa-anaimba-wimbo-wa-rais-na-raila-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sonko abadili siasa zake, sasa anaimba wimbo wa Rais na Raila</span></a>
