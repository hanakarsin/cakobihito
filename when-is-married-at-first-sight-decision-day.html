This is known as "Decision Day." The occasion frequently serves as a source of drama, with couples breaking up, making up, or even coupling up with others.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Season 17 kicked off on Oct. 18, 2023. While we don't yet have a confirmed Decision Day for Season 17, we can form a reasonable guess by looking at past seasons. During many of the recent seasons, Decision Day happened around Episode 17. If that remains true for Season 17 of MAFS, then Decision Day should fall on or around Feb. 7, 2024. Right in time for Valentine's Day, ironically enough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Season 17 of 'Married at First Sight' features the same relationship experts as last season.</h2><p>In addition to returning <a href=#>experts</a> Dr. Pepper Schwartz and Pastor Cal Roberson, Season 15 introduced <a href=#>two new experts</a>: DeVon Franklin and <a href=#>Dr. Pia Holec</a>, both of whom are back again for Season 17.</p><p>Dr. Pia is a sex therapist who, according to her profile in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Psychology Today</a>, has been practicing for more than 15 years.</p><p>She describes her work in the profile, saying, "I enjoy working with both individuals and couples who are experiencing a variety of issues such as anxiety, depression, mood disorders, personality disorders, and relationship discord.
