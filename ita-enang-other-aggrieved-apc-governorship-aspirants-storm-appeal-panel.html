Pointing out that by the time timetable of APC the event was billed to hold on Thursday, May 26 2022.</p><p>According to him, ‘’following the widely publicized standoff that commenced from the airport and culminated at the Udo Udoma/Oron Road Junction, in the ensuing mayhem, electoral materials and committee members who were already at risk were rescued by security operatives to safety.</p><p>‘’The process was disrupted. As a result of the incidence the INEC representatives and the head of security operatives announced to all present that due to the security implication the exercise has been suspended.</p><p>‘’Persuaded therefore by the charged atmosphere, and the counsel of the security chiefs, my supporters and I retired to our various homes. We were therefore, shocked to hear the following morning that the said primaries were conducted at a time and place as stated.’’</p><p>Utuk said he told the Okputu panel that he was intentionally excluded and disenfranchised from the process along with his supporters.</p><p>‘’Having not been a party to this process which clearly did not capture my interest and right I call for immediate cancellation of the purported primaries in Akwa Ibom State</p><p>‘’I am calling on the committee to take advantage of the one week window by INEC to cause proper gubernatorial primaries following the stipulated guidelines to be conducted as soon as possible in the state’’, he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FyZqKskWKyr63NoGSorJiav26txqCpop2mmrFurc%2BcZKCnppq%2Fr7vRrJ%2BiqF2WwLG10ZqlratdqMGwvsxmmKmolZa5brzAp5ylZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brandon-scott-jones-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Is Brandon Scott Jones Dating Anyone?</span></a>
