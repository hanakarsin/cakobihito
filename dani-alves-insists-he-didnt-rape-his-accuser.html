Dani Alves who has enjoyed a very successful football career at FC Barcelona, Juventus, and Paris Saint Germain, has been detained in Barcelona since January for allegedly raping a young lady in December.
Despite a series of attempts to be released on bail, the court in the city of Barcelona where he had the best of his football career, refused to grant him bail for the fear that he might run to his country, where Brazilians are not allowed by law to face extradition."><meta name=author content="Hettie Henneman"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
