This isn’t you disproving or dismissing a fact, this is you yielding to the trepidation that it is PO-ssible. “Import” is a strategy of APC that we won’t be employing. Rest”</p><p>@KelvinIkenga: “This is a state governor in Nigeria being openly tribalistic, & lacking all sense of decorum & finesse. Peter Obi’s only crime is being Igbo. Next time when Igbos tell u they’re hated, believe them. How can this openly tribalistic fellow be fair to all citizens in his state?”</p><p>@arizzto1011: “Look at what a governor is writing? Very insensitive. Your ha8 for Igbos will d3stroy you and all that you hold dear. Why are you afraid? Yet you want to come to the east to campaign right?”</p><p>@VictorIsrael_: “I don’t know how y’all see this but this sounds like a threat. If anything happens to any Nigerian in Kaduna who comes to stand in solidarity with Peter Obi, El Rufai should be held responsible. Bl00d sucking demon.”</p><p>@AfamDeluxo: “A pinch of salt Governor that has lost his state to terrorists being a bigot on Twitter. What else have you achieved in your existence apart from birthing simpleton that are all over Twitter looking for women to rape. Na why you brief like semicolon. Connard!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BuZmtoYmh6priMq6yfmZlirrXAwJyinpxdm7yzecyomqShnpx6qrPBqGStqpGZsrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./257618-baada-ya-miaka-mingi-tusker-project-jaji-mbishi-ian-mbugua-ni-babu-na-anapen-html.html><span>←</span><span>Baada ya miaka mingi Tusker Project, jaji mbishi Ian Mbugua ni babu na anapenda kazi yake</span></a>
