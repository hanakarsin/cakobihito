I came here today to move closer to God because I don’t expect the victory God gave to me.</p><p>“There is a need to move closer to God–if it is money, I don’t have it, it is power, I don’t have it, So today, I accept God as my personal Lord and saviour”.</p><p>Receiving the politician with great joy, the presiding pastor said, “I know this decision is the beginning of a new chapter in your life. I am happy to see you surrender your life to Jesus”.</p><p>Subsequently, Tony Kabaka who is a former aide of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Comrade <strong>Adams Oshiomhole,</strong> received Christmas relief from the Obaseki government, <strong>Naija News</strong> reports.</p><p>See photos below:</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-461728 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG-20211227-WA0019.jpg alt width=916 height=663 sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-461728 class=wp-caption-text>Tony Kabaka Gets Christmas Relief From Obaseki Govt</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG-20211227-WA0018-1024x913.jpg alt width=740 height=660 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG-20211227-WA0017-1024x805.jpg alt width=740 height=582 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG-20211227-WA0016.jpg alt width=994 height=663 sizes="(max-width: 994px) 100vw, 994px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG-20211227-WA0015-1024x963.jpg alt width=740 height=696 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5FxZqmgn6m8tHnRnqeepqSWu7V506ilsmWblq%2Bit8Bmnp6so2Kwqb7IrKummaNitKqy06xkn6qfonqwrsCsnKShXZy8t8CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./details-of-court-charges-against-anambra-ex-gov-willie-obiano.html><span>←</span><span>Details Of Court Charges Against Anambra Ex-Gov, Willie Obiano</span></a>
