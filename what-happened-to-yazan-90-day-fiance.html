Are they still together — what happened to them?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, what happened to Yazan and Brittany from '90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way'?</h2><p><a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way</a> offers a rare glimpse into how various couples navigate cultural differences, familial relationships, or even a language barrier. The 90 Day Fiancé spin-off revolves around U.S. natives who want to build a life for themselves far away from home.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the stars on the show managed to make their relationship work despite the significant obstacles, while others were a great deal less successful. Arguably, Yazan and Brittany might belong to the latter category.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>As Season 2 of the show revealed, Yazan and Brittany were struggling to overcome communication issues, problems arising from their vastly different lifestyles, and the language barrier.&nbsp;</p><p>In an episode, they failed to find each other at a crowded airport. In another, Yazan had to rely on a translator to tell Brittany why their marriage wouldn't bode well with his relatives.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>"As far as I'm concerned Yazan and I are done," Brittany remarked in "Fight or Flight?" before boarding her flight to Jordan.&nbsp;</p><p>Although her opinions may have changed somewhat during her trip to Jordan, it is becoming increasingly untenable for her and Yazan to pursue a healthy relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>"Not on My Watch" captured one of the less conflict-laden encounters between the stars. In the episode, Yazan told Brittany that she wouldn't be required to convert to Islam. He then went on to add that she would, however, have to marry him within a month, which she, understandably enough, didn't take to too well.&nbsp;</p><p>To make matters even more complicated, Brittany may have been still married at the time the conversation took place.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Brittany and Yazan could end up moving to the U.S.</h2><p>In the episode titled "The Cost of Love," Yazan's brother, Obaida, and the translator, Adam Lebzo, tried explain to Brittany what would happen to Yazan if he went ahead with the marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>As they emphasized, Yazan would risk excommunication, among other, even more frightening repercussions. Although Brittany offered to convert into Islam, they told her that the step alone wouldn't help Yazan's broader family change their minds.&nbsp;</p><p>In "Never Stop Fighting," Brittany made a new proposal, asking Jordan if he wanted to escape the ire of his family and move to the U.S. with her. Will this be the path the couple ends up taking? Are they going to end up happy after all? Only time will tell.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch new episodes of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way every Sunday at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSymaqWu26Fj2abmrFdm7aiusKe</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./invite-friends-raids-pokemon-go.html><span>←</span><span>How to Invite Your Friends to Remote Raids in 'Pokmon GO'</span></a>
